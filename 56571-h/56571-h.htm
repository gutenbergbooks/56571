<p class="tb">Henri Frankfort was born in 1897 in Holland. He
first studied history at Amsterdam University, obtained
his M.A. in London, but returned to the University of
Leiden for his Ph.D. He has done extensive field work
in the Near East, his main project being the Oriental
Institute of Chicago&rsquo;s excavations in Iraq from 1929 to
1937. Dr. Frankfort both organized and headed these
excavations, which yielded much new information on
the early history of Babylonia, from 4000 to 2000 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
In 1938 Dr. Frankfort went to Chicago to write and to
teach at the University of Chicago, which had appointed
him Research Professor of Oriental Archaeology
in 1932. In 1949 he was appointed Director of
the Warburg Institute and Professor of the History of
Pre-classical Antiquity in the University of London.
Among his other writings are numerous contributions
to professional journals and a book, <i>Ancient Egyptian
Religion</i> (1948). Dr. Frankfort died in 1954.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>A full description of the birth of civilization in the
Near East would require a work many times the size of
the present book. We have concentrated on the social
and political innovations in which the great change became
manifest. These bear most directly on the questions
to which the appearance of the first civilized
societies gives rise; yet they have received less attention
than the concomitant changes in the fields of
technology and the arts, the manifestations of religion,
or the invention of writing. In so far as technological
and artistic developments reveal social and political
conditions, we have taken them into account; but we
have not attempted to describe them in detail, and
have kept our subject within manageable limits by a
somewhat strict interpretation of the word civilization.
While it is true that the terms &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; and
&ldquo;culture&rdquo; count as synonyms in general usage, and
that every distinction therefore remains arbitrary,
there are etymological reasons for preferences in their
use. The word &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; with its overtones of something
irrational, something grown rather than made, is
preferred by those who study primitive peoples. The
word &ldquo;civilization,&rdquo; on the other hand, appeals to
those who consider man in the first place as <i>homo
politicus</i>, and it is in this sense that we would have our
title understood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>A question which we have left unanswered is that
of origins. The reader will find that in trimming the
ramifications of historical beginnings we have exposed
the trunks rather than the roots of Egyptian and Mesopotamian
civilization. To what extent can their roots
be known; what were the forces that brought them
into being? I think that the historian must deem this
question unanswerable. It can but lead him astray in
the direction of quasi-philosophical speculations, or
tempt him to give pseudo-scientific answers. It is the
latter alternative which has done most harm, for time
and again such changes as an increase in food-production
or technological advances (both, truly enough,
coincidental with the rise of civilization) have been
supposed to explain how civilization became possible.
This misconception bars the road to a deeper understanding.
For Whitehead&rsquo;s words are valid for past and
present alike:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each age of the world distinguished by high activity
there will be found at its culmination, and among the
agencies leading to that culmination, some profound cosmological
outlook, implicitly accepted, impressing its own
type upon the current springs of action. This ultimate cosmology
is only partly expressed, and the details of such
expression issue into derivative specialized questions ...
which conceal a general agreement upon first principles
almost too obvious to need expression, and almost too general
to be capable of expression. In each period there is a
general form of the forms of thought; and, like the air we
breathe, such a form is so translucent, and so pervading,
and so seemingly necessary, that only by extreme effort
can we become aware of it.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this effort which the historian cannot shirk,
nor is there a short cut to the understanding of an
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
alien past; but I believe that the comparative study of
parallel phenomena leads most surely to an elucidation
of manifest and implicit form.</p>
<p>I have confined myself to Egypt and Mesopotamia,
the cultural centres of the Ancient Near East; for in
the peripheral regions civilization arose late and was
always, to some extent, derivative. Egypt, too, was influenced
by Mesopotamia during its formative period,
but without losing its distinct and highly individual
character. This matter of early cultural contact is of
such importance for our problem that I have discussed
the relevant evidence in an <a href="#c7">Appendix</a>.</p>
<p>The following chapters are expanded versions of
lectures delivered at Indiana University, Bloomington,
in the winter of 1948-9, on the Patten Foundation. I
am grateful to Dr. Helene J. Kantor, of the Oriental
Institute, the University of Chicago, for generously

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">I. THE STUDY OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS</span></h2>
<p>Our subject is the birth of civilization in the Near
East. We shall not, therefore, consider the question
how civilization in the abstract became possible. I do
not think there is an answer to that question; in any
case it is a philosophical rather than a historical one.
But it may be said that the material we are going to
discuss has a unique bearing on it all the same. For the
emergence of Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization
has some claim to being considered as the birth of
civilization in a general sense. It is true that the transition
from primitive to civilized conditions has happened
more than once; but the change has mostly been
induced&mdash;or at least furthered&mdash;by contact with more
advanced foreigners. We know of only three instances
where the event may have been spontaneous: in the
ancient Near East, in China, and in South and Middle
America. However, the genesis of the Maya and Inca
civilizations is obscure, and for China we must count
with the possibility&mdash;some would say the likelihood&mdash;of
a stimulus from the West. But no appeal to foreign
influence can explain the emergence of civilized societies
in Egypt and Mesopotamia, since these lands
were the first to rise above a universal level of primitive
existence.</p>
<p>In the sequel we shall leave this aspect of our subject
to one side: in other words, though the fact that
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
in the Near East civilization arose spontaneously, and
for the first time imparts a particular weight and
splendour to the events, we are specifically concerned
with the events themselves. And here, at the very outset,
a difficulty must be faced.</p>
<p>It seems easy to deal in a general way with civilizations
as entities; at least this is commonly done. Arnold
Toynbee, in his <i>Study of History</i>, distinguishes without
hesitation twenty-one civilizations&mdash;&ldquo;specimens of
the species,&rdquo; belonging to the &ldquo;genus societies&rdquo;&mdash;by
what he believes to be an empirical method. But consider
the problem which arises when we want to study
the genesis of any one civilization in particular! We
cannot merely assume that it is an entity and has a
recognizable character of its own; we are bound to
make that character explicit in order that we may decide
<i>when</i> and <i>where</i> it emerged.</p>
<p>This problem is hardly ever envisaged by those who
are best acquainted with the actual remains of antiquity.
The archaeologist is either occupied with disentangling
successive phases in his stratified material;
or he constructs from his finds a fairly continuous story
of man&rsquo;s increasing skill and enterprise. In this context
the questions <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> we are entitled to speak
of the existence of Egyptian or Sumerian (<i>i.e.</i> early
Mesopotamian) civilization seem of secondary importance.
On the other hand, the philologist does not
encounter the question at all. For him, Sumerian or
Egyptian civilization exists from the moment when
texts were written in these languages.</p>
<p>Our problem is pre-eminently a historical one, and
it has, accordingly, two aspects: that of <i>identity</i> and
that of <i>change</i>. What constitutes the individuality of a
civilization, its recognizable character, its identity
which is maintained throughout the successive stages
of its existence? What, on the other hand, are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
changes differentiating one stage from the next? We
are not, of course, looking for a formula; the character
of a civilization is far too elusive to be reduced to a
catchword. We recognize it in a certain coherence
among its various manifestations, a certain consistency
in its orientation, a certain cultural &ldquo;style&rdquo; which
shapes its political and its judicial institutions, its art
as well as its literature, its religion as well as its morals.
I propose to call this elusive identity of a civilization
its &ldquo;form.&rdquo; It is this &ldquo;form&rdquo; which is never destroyed
although it changes in the course of time. And it
changes partly as a result of inherent factors&mdash;development&mdash;partly
as a result of external forces&mdash;historical
incidents. I propose to call the total of these changes
the &ldquo;dynamics&rdquo; of a civilization.</p>
<p>The interplay of form and dynamics constitutes the
history of a civilization and raises the question&mdash;which
lies outside our present inquiry&mdash;to what extent the
form of a civilization may determine its destiny.</p>
<p>For the moment, the distinction of form and dynamics
enables us to bring some clarity into the problems
connected with our present subject, the birth of
Near Eastern civilization. Under the aspect of &ldquo;form&rdquo;
we may ask: what actually does appear when this
civilization comes into being? Is its form established
piecemeal? If so, whence comes the coherence which
characterizes it throughout its historical existence? Under
the aspect of &ldquo;dynamics&rdquo; we may ask: is the
emergence of this civilization a gradual process? Are
earlier elements transmuted or combined by degrees,
or is the peculiar coherence of a mature civilization
the outcome of a sudden and intense change, a crisis
in which its form&mdash;undeveloped but potentially a
whole&mdash;crystallizes out, or rather, is born? The title of
this book indicates the answer which I think the evidence
compels us to accept as correct. But, before we
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
consider the evidence, it will be profitable to discuss
certain current opinions. For if it is true&mdash;as we have
said before&mdash;that those best acquainted with the ancient
Near East have rarely found occasion to consider
our problem, it is equally true, of course, that we are
not the first to discuss it.</p>
<p class="tb">Curiously enough, the two men who have devoted
their life&rsquo;s work to the problem of the genesis of civilization
have done so under a compelling awareness of
its decline. Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee both
wrote under the shadow of an impending world war;
and their work is, to some extent, warped by their preoccupation
with decay. Oswald Spengler&rsquo;s <i>Decline of
the West</i> was first published in 1917 and bears the subtitle,
<i>Outline of a Morphology of World History</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> This
indicates that the aspect of form (as we have called
it) is fully considered in his work. In this resides, as a
matter of fact, the element of lasting worth of his
sensational, arrogant, and pompous volumes. They
were written as a reaction against the prevalent view
of history which was prejudiced in two respects: it
considered world history exclusively from the western
standpoint; and it presumed, with evolutionary optimism,
that history exemplified the progress of humanity.
For Spengler the word &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; is merely an
empty phrase. The great civilizations are unconnected.
They are self-contained organisms of so individual a
nature that people who belong to one cannot understand
the achievements and modes of thought of another.
He maintains that not even in science does
knowledge show accumulations transcending the limits
of one civilization.</p>
<p>It would seem that under such conditions world
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
history is not feasible at all, and this has, in fact, been
maintained by no less a historian than Ernst Troeltsch.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
But Spengler thinks otherwise because he applies biological
methods to the study of civilizations. The very
word &ldquo;morphology,&rdquo; which figures in his sub-title,
usually denotes the study of form and structure in
plants and animals; it warns us to expect biological
categories and these, indeed, abound. For instance,
Spengler maintains that in different civilizations we
can find not <i>analogues</i>&mdash;features similar as regards
function&mdash;but only <i>homologues</i>&mdash;features similar as regards
form. He also maintains that the life-cycle of
each civilization runs through the same phases: youth,
maturity, and senescence. This implies that a comparison
of corresponding phases in different civilizations
may be instructive, but that it is merely confusing
to compare phases which do not correspond; for then
one is led to expect, for instance, that an ageing civilization
(like our own) might yet be able to produce
great poetry or a live religion, which are features
peculiar to civilizations in their youthful stage.</p>
<p>The birth of civilization is succinctly described by
Spengler in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It comes into flower on the soil of a precisely definable
region, to which it remains linked with a plant-like attachment.
A civilization dies when it has realized the sum total
of its potentialities in the guise of peoples, languages,
theologies, arts, states, sciences.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have omitted certain untranslatable references to an
<i>urseelenhafter Zustand</i> from which civilizations are
supposed to emerge and to which their &ldquo;souls&rdquo; return.
For the quotation shows clearly that Spengler, notwithstanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
these irrational additions, writes, like
Toynbee, under the spell of the nineteenth century and
attempts to interpret history in the terms of science.
Even if we admit that the country in which a civilization
arises influences its form, we must balk at Spengler&rsquo;s
formulation (repeated elsewhere in his work,
<i>e.g.</i> I, 29) which approaches materialistic determinism.
By interpreting the harmony between each civilization
and its natural setting in this manner, he denies a freedom
of the human spirit which&mdash;to name but one instance&mdash;the
achievements of the Greeks in Sicily and
southern Italy splendidly vindicate.</p>
<p>In describing the death of a civilization Spengler is
likewise under the spell of scientific notions. This is
not obvious; in fact, Spengler&rsquo;s success is largely due
to the plausibility of some of his most imaginative
statements. We feel that it makes sense, even that it is
illuminating, to speak of a youthful, or ageing, or dying
civilization. But for Spengler such phrases are not
metaphors; and when he speaks (as in the previous
quotation) of a civilization&rsquo;s dying &ldquo;when it has realized
the sum total of its potentialities,&rdquo; he believes
that he refers to a state of affairs as inevitable and as
accurately predictable as the withering of a plant. He
actually calls civilizations &ldquo;living beings of the highest
order,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and he undertakes to state with precision
which phenomena characterize each stage in their life-cycle.
For him, an imperialistic and socialistic order
follow a traditional and hierarchical society; expanding
technique and trade follow greatness in art, music,
and literature as certainly as the dispersal of the seeds
follows the maturing of a plant which will never flower
again. But to take the biological metaphor literally, to
grant in this manner reality to an image, is not morphology
but mythology; and it is belief, not knowledge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
which induces Spengler to deny the freedom of
the spirit and the unpredictability of human behaviour.</p>
<p>Spengler substitutes the mystery of natural life for
the dynamics of history which he, therefore, fails entirely
to explain.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> But to the aspect of &ldquo;form&rdquo; he has
done justice as few before him. Here too, however, he
goes much too far. It is one thing to stress the singularity
of each great epoch of the past as a prerequisite
of deeper understanding, and quite another to declare
the discontinuity of cultural achievements to be absolute.
Had the first been Spengler&rsquo;s intention, no one
who had once comprehended the uniqueness of a historical
situation, a work of art, or an institution, would
have quarrelled with his dictum: &ldquo;Each civilization
has its own possibilities of expression, which appear,
mature and wither, and never recur.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> When he states,
furthermore, &ldquo;I see in world-history the image of a
perennial configuration and transfiguration, a wonderful
formation and dissolution of organic forms. The
professional historian, however, sees in it the image of
a tape-worm which tirelessly puts forth period after
period,&rdquo; there is enough truth in this scathing remark
for it to strike home. It is a negative truth, but it is
born of a true perception of the poverty of our usual
view of history as an evolutionary process. This view
encourages us to project the axioms, habits of thought,
and norms of the present day into the past, which, as a
result, seems to contain little that is unfamiliar to us.
It is remarkable how rarely historians of ancient or
alien civilizations have guarded themselves against
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
that danger. In this respect Herodotus was more perspicacious;
he realized that the values of different cultures
may be incommensurate when he frankly epitomized
his description of Ancient Egypt in the
statement that its laws and customs were, on the
whole, the opposite of those of the rest of mankind.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
This peculiar integration of the facts satisfied a Greek
facing Barbarians. We, however, seek understanding.
We can be resigned neither to registering astonishment
nor to accepting the solution which a misconceived
regard for objectivity sometimes proposes: a mere
chronicling of the facts. We cannot rest content when
we know that the Egyptians considered their king a
god, entombed him in a pyramid, buried cats and
dogs, and mummified their dead. We want to recover
the cultural &ldquo;form&rdquo; in which these odd phenomena
find their proper place and meaning. But it is a laborious,
and never completed, task to rediscover the original
coherence of a past mode of life from the surviving
remains. Spengler attempts short cuts; overrating
the extent of his truly remarkable erudition, and, for
the rest, trusting recklessly his intuition, he forces the
evidence to fit the schemata which he has conceived.
He describes, for instance, the bearer of Egyptian
civilization as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Egyptian soul&mdash;pre-eminently gifted for and inclined
towards history, striving with primeval passion towards the
infinite&mdash;experienced past and future as its entire universe,
and the present ... but as a narrow borderland between
two measureless distances. The Egyptian civilization is an
embodiment of concern&mdash;the soul&rsquo;s correlate of distance&mdash;concern
with the future, manifest in the choice of granite
and basalt as the material for sculpture, in the engraved
documents, in the elaboration of a masterly system of administration
and a net of irrigation works; of necessity a
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
concern with the past is linked with this concern for the
future.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hold this image of ancient Egypt evoked by Spengler
to be totally at variance with the evidence. I have
recently interpreted this evidence and described how
(to take up the points raised by Spengler) the Egyptians
had very little sense of history or of past and
future. For they conceived their world as essentially
static and unchanging. It had gone forth complete
from the hands of the Creator. Historical incidents
were, consequently, no more than superficial disturbances
of the established order, or recurring events of
never-changing significance. The past and the future&mdash;far
from being a matter of concern&mdash;were wholly implicit
in the present; and the odd facts enumerated
above&mdash;the divinity of animals and kings, the pyramids,
mummification&mdash;as well as several other and seemingly
unrelated features of Egyptian civilization&mdash;its moral
maxims, the forms peculiar to its poetry and prose&mdash;can
all be understood as a result of a basic conviction
that only the changeless is truly significant.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> I do not
offer this summary as a formula by means of which
Egyptian civilization becomes comprehensible, for it
explains nothing by itself and does not pretend to replace
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the detailed and concrete description of Egyptian
life and thought which it summarizes. Nor can
even such a detailed description ever be final or entirely
comprehensive. I do hold that a viewpoint
whence many seemingly unrelated facts are seen to
acquire meaning and coherence is likely to represent
a historical reality; at least, I know of no better definition
of historical truth. But each new insight discloses
new complexities which now demand elucidation,
while at all times a number of facts are likely to remain
outside any network to be established. However, if
our view is true as far as it goes, then Spengler&rsquo;s view
is baseless.</p>
<p>Spengler&rsquo;s lack of respect for the phenomena has a
twofold cause. It is due in part to his overweening conceit,
in part to his lack of experience. Like Toynbee,
he is truly familiar only with classical antiquity and its
western descendant. His <i>Urmensch</i>, his &ldquo;primordial
man,&rdquo; is the Greek or the Aryan Indian.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> He ignores
altogether the work of those who have ventured outside
the familiar in order to meet an alien spirit on its
own terms&mdash;the anthropologists, or, more precisely, the
ethnologists or cultural anthropologists. These scholars
have come up against behaviour defying every modern
norm in their personal contact with primitive peoples,
and in their encounters discovered an approach to the
study of alien cultures which the historian of antiquity
would be wise to make his own. The ethnologist will
not take for granted savage customs and usages which
seem comprehensible&mdash;even familiar&mdash;to him. For he
has observed that cultural traits cannot be studied in
isolation since they are integral parts of a whole&mdash;the
given civilization&mdash;and derive their meaning from the
particular whole in which they occur. Ruth Benedict,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
in her lucid <i>Patterns of Culture</i>, states the case as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is in cultural life as it is in speech: selection is the
prime necessity.... We must imagine a great arc on
which are ranged the possible interests provided either by
the human age-cycle or by the environment or by man&rsquo;s
various activities. A culture that capitalized even a considerable
proportion of these would be as unintelligible as
a language that used all the clicks, all the glottal stops, all
the labials, dentals, sibilants and gutturals from voiceless
to voiced, and from oral to nasal. Its identity as a culture
depends upon the selection of some segments of this arc.
Every human society everywhere has made such a selection
in its cultural institutions. Each, from the point of
view of another, ignores fundamentals and exploits irrelevancies.
One culture hardly recognizes monetary values;
another has made them fundamental in every field of behaviour.
In one society technology is unbelievably slighted
even in those aspects of life which seem necessary to ensure
survival; in another, equally simple, technological
achievements are complex and fitted with admirable nicety
to the situation. One builds an enormous cultural superstructure
upon adolescence, one upon death, one upon
afterlife.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence&mdash;and as a warning to those who are partial to
utilitarian explanations: &ldquo;The importance of an institution
in a culture gives no direct indication of its usefulness
or its inevitability,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> for cultural behaviour is
integrated and the whole determines the significance
of the parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within each culture there come into being characteristic
purposes not necessarily shared by other types of society.
In obedience to these purposes each people further and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
further consolidates its experience ... and the most ill-assorted
acts become characteristic of its peculiar goals,
often by the most unlikely metamorphoses. The form that
these acts take we can understand only by understanding
first the emotional and intellectual mainsprings of that
society.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>We have seen that any society selects some segment of
the arc of possible human behaviour, and in so far as it
achieves integration its institutions tend to further the expression
of its selected segment and to inhibit the opposite
expressions.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, in this last passage, a suggestion of the dynamics
of the formation of a civilization but it is not
this aspect but that of &ldquo;form&rdquo; which prevails in the
work of Benedict or Malinowski. For modern savages
are relatively stagnant if we discount the disturbances
caused by the white man. Hence the title <i>Patterns of
Culture</i>.</p>
<p>It is, however, precisely the problem of the dynamics
of cultural change&mdash;a problem misconstrued by Spengler
and rightly ignored by Ruth Benedict&mdash;which lies
at the centre of Arnold Toynbee&rsquo;s work. The first three
volumes of <i>A Study of History</i> appeared in 1934, a
second group of three in 1939, and a final group is still
to be published. But we are told that the preoccupation
from which the work has sprung, goes back as far
as 1911, when Toynbee travelled in Crete and saw the
newly discovered remains of the sea-empire of Minos.
Then he chanced on the ruins of a Venetian villa,
remnant of the time when Venice had dominated the
Mediterranean with its galleys. And Toynbee was disconcerted
at the thought that yet another empire that
&ldquo;rules the waves&rdquo; even in our own day might follow
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
its predecessors in decline.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> Now a preoccupation
with decay such as underlies Toynbee&rsquo;s work need not
in itself vitiate study of the birth of civilization; however,
the &ldquo;change and identity&rdquo; of cultural forms must
not be handled mechanically but with all the reverence
for the singular which historical material demands.
And it is here rather than in errors of fact
(which are inevitable in a work of this scope) that we
find Toynbee&rsquo;s work defective. We must, moreover,
take exception to his lack of critical precision and to
the inadequacy of his conceptual apparatus.</p>
<p>Toynbee, like Spengler, invests certain images which
he uses with a spurious reality. These ostensible similes
pervade the argument with an implied assurance
that they reflect historical situations. When Toynbee
compares civilizations with motor cars on a one-way
street,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> or with men resting or climbing on a mountainside,
he conveys the impression (which he himself
judges correct) that a definite direction, a forward or
upward movement, is discernible in history. But such
dynamics are imputed, not observed. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primitive societies, as we know them by direct observation,
may be likened to people lying torpid upon a ledge
on a mountainside, with a precipice below and a precipice
above; civilizations may be likened to companions of these
&ldquo;sleepers of Ephesus&rdquo; who have just risen to their feet and
have started to climb on up the face of the cliff.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This image (further elaborated in the book, and duly
illustrated with a picture in <i>Time</i> magazine) does a
great deal more than tell us that primitive societies are
static and civilizations dynamic. The dominating feature
of the image is the rock cliff with its succession of
ledges and precipices. Where is the historical reality
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
corresponding to this scenery which exists <i>independent</i>
of the sleepers and climbers and <i>determines</i> their direction?
The &ldquo;one-way street&rdquo; likewise suggests a
predetermined orientation and limitation of cultural
endeavour. Toynbee believes that there is a cliff to be
climbed, a street to be followed. Yet the truth is&mdash;in
the terms of his images&mdash;that we see figures at rest or
on the move in a cloudy space but know nothing about
their relative position: we do not know which ledge is
above or below which other ledge. Or again: we see
motor cars moving, halting, or out of order. But we do
not know whether they move in an alley, or on a four-drive
highway, on an open plain, or within a circle&mdash;we
do not even know whether there is an entrance or
exit at all.</p>
<p>Toynbee&rsquo;s images betray an evolutionistic as well as
a moral bias which interferes with the historian&rsquo;s supreme
duty of doing justice to each civilization on its
own terms. Why should we characterize civilizations
which have achieved a deep and lasting harmony (like
those of the Zuni or of certain Polynesians) as &ldquo;arrested
civilizations&rdquo; where &ldquo;no energy is left over for
reconnoitring the course of the road ahead, or the face
of the cliff above them, with a view to a further advance&rdquo;?<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>
Where is this road or this cliff? Why should
these chimaeras and a feverish desire for &ldquo;advancement&rdquo;
disturb the satisfaction of people who have attained
the double integration of individual and society
and of society and nature? Toynbee merely projects
postulates which fulfil an emotional need in the West
into human groups whose values lie elsewhere. In our
own terms: Toynbee declares the &ldquo;dynamism&rdquo; of
western civilization to be universally valid; and he can
do that only by ignoring the &ldquo;form&rdquo; of non-western
civilizations. But understanding is thereby precluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Toynbee is not the first historian to introduce the
notion of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; in his work, and the fallacy of
this procedure has been well demonstrated by Collingwood.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>
Of his arguments we can quote only two passages.
He maintains that a historian comparing two
historical periods or ways of life must be able to &ldquo;understand
(them) historically, that is with enough sympathy
and insight to reconstruct their experience for
himself.&rdquo; But that means that he has already accepted
them as things to be judged by their own standards.
Each is for the historian &ldquo;a form of life having its own
problems, to be judged by its success in solving those
problems and no others. Nor is he assuming that the
two different ways of life were attempts to do one and
the same thing and asking whether the second did it
better than the first. Bach was not trying to write like
Beethoven and failing; Athens was not a relatively unsuccessful
attempt to produce Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood then indicates the exceptional (and
really purely academic) case in which one may be entitled
to speak of progress,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> and in doing so touches
upon a subject with which modern man is particularly
concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we speak of progress in happiness or comfort or
satisfaction? Obviously not.... The problem of being
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
comfortable in a medieval cottage is so different from the
problem of being comfortable in a modern slum that there
is no comparing them; the happiness of a peasant is not
contained in the happiness of a millionaire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toynbee, though he is less precise than Collingwood,
does formulate what he means by progress. He equates
it with growth, and &ldquo;growth is progress towards self-determination.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
But Toynbee, who is a believing
Christian, surely knows that self-determination may
not be a matter of gradual advance at all, but rather a
flash-like illumination in which one&rsquo;s true nature
stands revealed. As a rule, the sequel to this experience
is a life-long struggle for a realization of the
vision. Why could not this type of self-determination
also, like the slow and gradual realization, have an
analogy in the life of civilizations? Flinders Petrie and
others have maintained that every significant trait of
Egyptian culture had been evolved before the end of
the Third Dynasty. We find once more that Toynbee
has uncritically proclaimed the universal validity of
one of several possible sequences. And if he describes
&ldquo;the consummation of human history&rdquo; as &ldquo;accomplishing
the transformation of Sub-Man through Man
into Super-Man&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> and calls this &ldquo;the goal towards
which &lsquo;the whole creation groaneth and travaileth&rsquo;
(Romans viii, 22),&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> we may respect his faith but
can hardly accept it as the argument of an &ldquo;empirical
student of history.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>It is, in fact, odd that Toynbee, who opens his work
with an excellent statement of the relativity of historical
thought, who complains that &ldquo;a local and temporary
standpoint has given our historians a false perspective,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
remains himself so completely under the
spell of a nineteenth-century western outlook. His evolutionary
bias, his empiricism, and his treatment of
civilizations as &ldquo;specimens of a species&rdquo; are all of a
piece. He sometimes equals Spengler in myth-making,
treating his equation of civilizations and living beings
as a reality, and appealing to biological opinion to uphold
a historical conclusion.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> His use of &ldquo;species&rdquo;
and &ldquo;genus&rdquo; obscures the fundamental fact that
science can study individuals as members of a species
only by ignoring their individual characteristics. The
historian, following this course, would defeat the very
purpose of his work.</p>
<p>In fact, Toynbee&rsquo;s vaunted empiricism is an attempt
to transpose the method of the natural sciences, where
experiment is essential and experience is reduced to
figures, to history, where experiment is impossible and
experience subjective. Toynbee&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience&rdquo; (a
word which, in the case of a historian, may stand for
intimate acquaintance with historical data) is confined
to classical antiquity and its western descendant. It is
an odd fact that he should have supposed this limited
field capable of supplying the conceptual apparatus
with which every historical phenomenon could be
comprehended, and that he should have done this, not
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
unconsciously, but knowingly, although unaware of
the enormity of his assumption. For anyone moving
outside western tradition should soon discover the
truth that the values found in different civilizations
are incommensurate. And so we find Toynbee, like
Spengler, doing violence to the evidence and forcing
each civilization into a preconceived system of categories.
In his case the system is not, like Spengler&rsquo;s, an
imaginative construction; but it is derived from the
crucial period in western history when the Roman Empire
disintegrated. His generalization of particular circumstances
results not in historical errors but in
irrelevancies. It would be a tedious and laborious task
to demonstrate this to the full; but let us take two
characteristic quotations referring to Egypt.</p>
<p>Toynbee expects to find in every civilization an
analogy of the early Christian Church in the Roman
Empire, and thus postulates for Egypt an &ldquo;Osireian
Church&rdquo; as a &ldquo;universal church created by an internal
proletariat.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> Now, a &ldquo;church&rdquo; as an organized body
of believers was not known in Egypt at any time (nor
in Mesopotamia, for that matter). The worship of
Osiris, always a main concern of the king, spread
through all classes of the population, but merely as one
among many devotions which filled the life of every
Egyptian; the god was never honoured by one group
more than by another. And, in fact, no section of the
population of Egypt can be called a proletariat if this
word is to remain applicable to imperial Rome or to
modern times. If, elsewhere,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> Toynbee describes the
expulsion of the Hyksos invaders from Egypt as due to
a &ldquo;<i>union sacr&eacute;e</i> between the dominant minority of the
Egyptiac society and its internal proletariat against
the external proletariat as represented by the Hyksos&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
one can only say that the words, severally and in conjunction,
do not apply. But he continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for it was this reconciliation at the eleventh hour that prolonged
the existence of the Egyptiac society&mdash;in a petrified
state of life-in-death&mdash;for two thousand years beyond the
date when the progress of disintegration would otherwise
have reached its natural term in dissolution. And this life-in-death
was not merely an unprofitable burden to the
moribund Egyptiac society itself; it was also a fatal blight
upon the growth of the living Osireian church ... for this
<i>union sacr&eacute;e</i> ... took the form of an amalgamation of
the living worship of Osiris with the dead worship of the
official Egyptiac pantheon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this, one would not suspect that the five centuries
following the expulsion of the Hyksos are the
most brilliant epoch of Egyptian history. One would
also not assume that after about one thousand years of
this &ldquo;life-in-death,&rdquo; religious texts glorifying Amon-Re
were written which in profundity of thought and
literary splendour belong to the greatest in Egyptian
literature, and are its nearest approach to the majestic
monotheism of the Old Testament.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> Surely an &ldquo;empirical&rdquo;
approach would have started from the fact
that Egyptian civilization did actually retain its vitality
over an unusually long period. Toynbee, however, declares
that the Egyptian achievements in the second
and first millennia <span class="small">B.C.</span> are but illusions, for the scheme
to which he is committed (although it is alien, and
hence irrelevant, to Egyptian history) requires a
&ldquo;time of troubles&rdquo; before the Middle Kingdom<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
which must be followed by a &ldquo;universal church&rdquo; with
its two types of proletariat. Thus the confessed &ldquo;empiricist&rdquo;
adheres to a preconceived system and disposes
of the facts by proclaiming the Hyksos period
&ldquo;a date when the process of disintegration <i>would
otherwise</i> have reached its <i>natural</i> term in dissolution.&rdquo;
(The italics are mine.)</p>
<p>The scheme which we have criticized in its application
to Egypt is intended to render account of the
dynamics of civilizations in their last phases. For the
early phases, the classical world cannot supply ready-made
notions. Here Toynbee introduces a set of formulas
which may be summarized in his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Growth is achieved, when an individual, or a minority,
or a whole society, replies to a challenge by a response,
which not only answers the particular challenge that has
evoked it, but also exposes the respondent to a fresh challenge
which demands a fresh response on his part. And
the process of growth continues, in any given case, so long
as this recurrent movement of disturbance and restoration
and overbalance and renewed disturbance of equilibrium
is maintained.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But communities react differently under a common
challenge; some are apt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to succumb whereas others strike out a successful response
through a creative movement of Withdrawal-and-Return,
while others again, neither succeed in responding along
original lines nor fail to respond altogether, but manage
to survive the crisis by waiting until some creative individual
or creative minority has shown the way through,
and then following tamely in the footsteps of the pioneers.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>These plausible words do not, upon closer inspection,
explain the problem which concerns us. The &ldquo;creative
movement of Withdrawal-and-Return&rdquo; is illustrated
by examples which rob it not only of its obvious, but
of all definite, meaning.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>The other formula&mdash;that of &ldquo;Challenge-and-Response&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>&mdash;is
not evolved from inside history either
but is applied, as it were, from the outside; and its
applicability, let alone its power to explain the facts,
is often more than doubtful. &ldquo;Challenge-and-Response&rdquo;
is sometimes used to describe a true conflict;
sometimes it refers merely to the ordinary seesaw of
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
historical fortune. Always, however, it has a misleading
ring, since <i>observed facts</i> are called a response, to
a <i>hypothetical challenge</i> construed to meet those facts.
In Volume II, &ldquo;The Range of Challenge-and-Response,&rdquo;
we find headings like &ldquo;The Stimulus of Hard
Countries,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Stimulus of New Ground,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Stimulus of Blows,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Stimulus of Pressure,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Stimulus of Penalization,&rdquo; and so on. The primary data
of history merely show that certain peoples achieved
greatness; Toynbee thinks that the adverse conditions
which he enumerates served as stimuli. That may be
so. In any case, it does not explain the fact which,
above all others, requires explanation, namely, that in
some cases these conditions worked as stimuli and in
others they did not. I do not find, therefore, that the
formula is conducive to understanding; it must in each
case invent a challenge to fit a historical reality which
it labels response.</p>
<p>Our criticism does not proceed from a positivistic
belief in a so-called &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; historiography which
is supposed first to assemble objective facts which are
subsequently interpreted. Our objection here is not
against Toynbee&rsquo;s procedure, but against a terminology
which obscures what is the starting-point, and
what the outcome, of his procedure. And we make the
further criticism that he does not actually evolve from
each particular historical situation the notion of a particular
challenge to which it can be construed as a response;
he applies the formula, as I have said, from the
outside, and it is therefore doomed to irrelevance. For
example: Toynbee considers the descent of the prehistoric
Egyptians into the marshy Nile valley as their
response to the challenge of the desiccation of North
Africa. In their new homeland they faced, in due
course, as a further challenge, &ldquo;the internal articulation
of the new-born Egyptiac society&rdquo; and failed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
The truth is that the Egyptians flourished exceedingly
for two thousand years after the Pyramid Age; but
Toynbee thinks they failed because he cannot conceive
of a &ldquo;response&rdquo; in Egyptian terms, but only in those
with which he is familiar: secular government, democracy,
and the Poor Law.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> But since neither the rich
nor the poor Egyptians took this view of their state,
Toynbee&rsquo;s conclusion is irrelevant. It is true that he
quotes the tales which dragomans told to late Greek
travellers about the oppressive rule of the builders of
the pyramids. But the actual folk-tales of Pharaonic
Egypt show us that the people took as great a delight
in tales of royalty as the public of the Arabian Nights
took in the doings of the despot Harun al Rashid.
Snefru, whom Toynbee names, is known as one of the
most popular rulers in legend. The fact of the matter
is that Toynbee should have started from an analysis
of the &ldquo;response.&rdquo; This would not have shown, as
Toynbee has it, that &ldquo;Death laid its icy hand on the
life of the growing civilization at the moment when
the challenge that was the stimulus of its growth was
transferred from the external to the internal field
[from the subjugation of nature to the organization of
society, H.F.] because in this new situation, the shepherds
of the people betrayed their trust.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> Studied
without preconceived ideas the &ldquo;response&rdquo; of the
Egyptians stands revealed as a vastly different achievement.
The ideal of a marvellously integrated society
had been formed long before the pyramids were built;
it was as nearly realized, when they were built, as any
ideal social form can be translated into actuality; and
it remained continuously before the eyes of rulers and
people alike during subsequent centuries. It was an
ideal which ought to thrill a western historian by its
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
novelty, for it falls entirely outside the experience of
Greek or Roman or Modern Man, although it survives,
in an attenuated form, in Africa. It represents a harmony
between man and the divine which is beyond
our boldest dreams, since it was maintained by divine
power which had taken charge of the affairs of man in
the person of Pharaoh. Society moved in unison with
nature. Justice, which was the social aspect of the
cosmic order, pervaded the commonwealth. The
&ldquo;trust&rdquo; which the people put in their &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo;
was by no means what Toynbee imagines; their trust
was that Pharaoh should wield to the full the absolute
power to which his divinity entitled him, and which
enabled him&mdash;as nothing else could&mdash;to ensure the
well-being of the whole community.</p>
<p class="tb">It seems to me that these discussions have cleared
the ground for our understanding. Generalizations
based on a limited historical experience, and theorizing,
however ingeniously conducted, <i>must</i> fail to
disclose the individual character of any one civilization
or of any one series of events. We must concentrate
on what Ruth Benedict called the &ldquo;selected segment
of the arc of possible human behaviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
characteristic purposes not necessarily shared by other
types of society.&rdquo; In our own terms: In studying the
birth of a civilization we are concerned with the emergence
of its &ldquo;form.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">II. THE PREHISTORY OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST</span></h2>
<p>At the end of our last chapter we said that the study
of the birth of a civilization means watching the emergence
of its &ldquo;form.&rdquo; We have also seen that this
&ldquo;form&rdquo; is elusive, that it is not a concrete mould, or a
standard which we can apply to our observations to
see whether they conform with it. We have described
it as &ldquo;a certain consistency in orientation, a cultural
style.&rdquo; Recognizing it amounts to discovering a point
of view from where seemingly unrelated facts acquire
coherence and meaning. Even so the &ldquo;form&rdquo; of a
civilization remains intangible; it is implicit in the preoccupations
and valuations of the people. It imparts to
their achievements&mdash;to their arts and institutions, their
literature, their theology&mdash;something distinct and final,
something which has its own peculiar perfection.
Therefore a discussion of the emergence of form entails
a knowledge of a civilization in its maturity, a
familiarity with its classical expression in every field.
Then it should be possible to work backwards from
better-known to early times until the point is reached
where the familiar phenomena are lost sight of and
where, conversely, their emergence must be postulated.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>This procedure, however, has a double disadvantage.
It obscures development because it moves
against the current of time; and it fails to describe,
first of all, the conditions under which the civilization
took shape&mdash;in other words, its prehistoric antecedents.
Now I am not prepared to attempt a definition of the
distinction between prehistory and history in general
terms, for even within the ancient Near East the distinction
is problematical.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> I shall simply use the term
&ldquo;prehistory&rdquo; to denote the period preceding the emergence
of Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization, and
shall discuss first the climatic conditions in the Near
East at that time and then the form of society which
prevailed before the events with which we are primarily
concerned took place.</p>
<p>At present the arable lands of Egypt and Western
Asia are embedded in large tracts of desert. But it
seems that in the Ice Age the pressure of cold air over
Europe compelled the Atlantic rain storms to travel
east by a more southerly track so that the whole area
from the west coast of Africa to the Persian mountains
was a continuous belt of park and grassland. In
Algeria and southern Tripolitania hunters of the Old
Stone Age engraved images of elephants, buffaloes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and giraffes on rocks now surrounded for hundreds of
miles by an arid waste where life is utterly impossible.
Paleolithic implements have been found on the high
desert which flanks the Nile valley, and in Syria, Palestine,
and Kurdistan. Carved tools found in Palestine
(<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, A, B) and the engravings from North Africa
find close parallels in the splendid engravings and
paintings from the caves of southern France and northern
Spain.</p>
<p>We want to dwell for a moment on the paleolithic
remains in order to insist that even these distant hunters
cannot be understood as &ldquo;part of nature.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> From
paleolithic times onwards, man has been aware of being
involved, not only with his kindred, but with superhuman
powers. This dual involvement becomes apparent
as soon as we find more than the mere bones
and implements of man. In France and Spain hunters
of the Old Stone Age left us astonishing paintings and
engravings depicting the game upon which they were
dependent. These works of art are found in the remote
depths of caves and could only be reached at mortal
risk. Analogies found among modern people still living
in the Stone Age allow us to see in the marvellous
images of the beasts, the traces of dancing feet on the
soil of the caves, the stones marked with linear signs,
the figures of masked or dancing men, expressions of a
coherent religious conception, proclaiming man&rsquo;s intimate
and reciprocal relationship with the animals, and
beyond these, with the divine. Such a brief formula is,
of course, ludicrously inadequate;<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> for one thing it
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
substitutes articulate concepts for unreflected experience.
But we formulate it in order to emphasize that,
from the first, man possessed creative imagination, and
we have to reckon with this in considering social cohesion.
If the earliest men of whom we have knowledge
co-operated in order to trap and kill animals far more
powerful than themselves, their hunting differed <i>toto
c&aelig;lo</i> from the hunting of a pack of wolves. Their art
proves that their relation with their game was not a
mere matter of killing and devouring, and that their
parties were kept together, not merely by common
need, but also by imaginative, religious conceptions,
made explicit, not in doctrine, but in acts.</p>
<p>The transition from paleolithic to neolithic culture
is not yet known; but we do know that a change of
climate, which started in the Old Stone Age, continued
in the New, and very gradually changed living conditions
throughout the Near East. Libya remained rich
in vineyards, olive trees, and cattle up to the end of
the second millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;a fact which may be surmised
from records of booty brought back from there:
by a Pharaoh of the First Dynasty;<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> by Sahure of the
Fifth Dynasty (about 2475 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), who listed 100,000
head of cattle and more than 200,000 each of asses,
goats, and sheep;<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> and finally by Ramses III (about
1175 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), who was still able to take away 3600 head
of cattle, in addition to horses, asses, sheep, and goats.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
At the opposite end of the Near East, in south-eastern
Iran, Sir Aurel Stein was unable to round up a &ldquo;minimum
of local labour&rdquo; to investigate the thickly dotted
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
ruins of ancient settlements.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> Nevertheless, progressive
desiccation marked the period from perhaps 7000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
onwards, turning the plateaux from grassland into
steppe and, ultimately, into desert, and making the
valleys of the great rivers inhabitable. When meadows
and shrub lands began to emerge from the swamps and
mudflats along the river courses, man descended from
the highlands.</p>
<p>Now the earliest inhabitants of the valleys were in
possession of a considerable body of knowledge which
the hunters of the Ice Age had lacked. And we do not
know how the change from old to new, from the Old
Stone Age to the New Stone Age, came about; for nowhere
has a series of continuous remains covering the
transition been <i>recognized</i>. I use this word advisedly,
for we shall see in a moment that the change was of
such a nature that its earliest consequences may well
defy recognition. We know, however, that this change,
like the later one with which we are more especially
concerned, took place in the Near East.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>The outstanding new feature of the neolithic age is
agriculture, with emmer wheat (<i>Triticum dicoccum</i>)
and six-rowed barley (<i>Hordeum hexastichum</i>) as the
main crops. Now the wild ancestors of these grains
survive even to-day in Syria and Palestine. In the same
region, in caves on Mount Carmel, were discovered
remains of the earliest men who used sickles.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> This
does not prove, of course, that they <i>cultivated</i> grain;
they may merely have <i>harvested</i> grasses which grew
wild. The point is of importance since these people&mdash;known
in archaeological literature as Natufians&mdash;belong
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
to the very end of the Old Stone Age. Yet the
Natufians were the initiators, or at least the early practitioners,
of a technique of harvesting which survived
in the earliest agricultural settlements of neolithic
times. Their peculiar sickles consisted of a grooved
haft of bone in which short pieces of flint&mdash;&ldquo;teeth&rdquo;&mdash;were
mounted (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> A, B).<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> Such sickles are also
found in the oldest settlements in the Fayum (in
Egypt) (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> D),<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> at Hassuna in northern Iraq,<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
and at Sialk near Kashan in Persia (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> C).<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> They
date perhaps about 5000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, possibly a thousand
years or more after the Natufians. In Egypt, during the
First Dynasty (about 3100 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), the sickle-haft was
improved by being curved; it was now made of wood
but retained its cutting edge of small
flints (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> E),<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> and sickles of this type were used as late as the
Twelfth Dynasty (about 2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> In Iraq, too,
sickles with curved wooden handles in which flint
teeth were set were used as late as the Second Early
Dynasty period, about 2700 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> In Asia Minor and
Europe no trace of the hafts has survived, but the distinctive
flint teeth have been found in Anatolia, South
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Russia, on the Danube, and at the western end of the
Mediterranean at Almeria. They occur also throughout
North Africa. It is clear, then, that the diffusion of
agriculture consisted not merely in spreading the
knowledge of emmer and barley but in a simultaneous
diffusion of the odd and complex harvesting tool, first
used, as far as we know, by the Natufians. Radiating
from the Near East, the new knowledge spread in
widening circles, reaching the shores of the Baltic and
the North Sea about 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> However, many questions
remain at present unanswered. When did men
undertake to improve the wild grasses and to produce,
by cross-breeding and selection, the vastly more nutritious
grains which were known to the earliest farmers
of the neolithic period? When, in fact, was the
extraordinary first step taken and the satisfaction of
immediate needs limited in order to save seeds, store
them, safeguard them against insects and rodents, and
sow them when the time was propitious? This may
have been done by the Natufians, but of this we know
nothing. Furthermore, we do not know how far agricultural
methods had advanced when they began to be
diffused throughout the Old World. In particular we
know nothing about the origin of irrigation, which
played so large a part in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and
which has been repeatedly recognized as a factor
greatly furthering social and political cohesion, since it
makes each settlement dependent on its neighbours.
We must, therefore, consider this invention.</p>
<p>It deserves notice that irrigation can be resorted to
by people who do not cultivate but collect wild-growing
plants. This is done, for instance, by certain Indians
of the Great Basin of Western North America,<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> and
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
their methods could very well have been followed by
the Natufians utilizing the wadi running at the foot of
their cliffs. We may admit, then, that irrigation <i>could</i>
have been one of the features of the original agricultural
complex which spread from the Near East;
but there are serious arguments to the contrary.</p>
<p>In the first place, the spread of agriculture seems to
have been achieved by means of a slow migration of
the cultivators. Primitive hoe or garden cultivation
(which is still practised) exhausts the soil it uses. It
ignores rotation of crops or fallowing; after some years
a fresh piece of ground must be cleared and sown.
When the neighbourhood has been farmed, the village
moves farther into the bush. The smallness of the
neolithic settlements and of their cemeteries,<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a> and
the manner in which they spread into the European
continent, suggests this type of slow but continual migration
outwards from the centre where agriculture
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
was first practised. There is no dependence on irrigation
to be observed here.</p>
<p>In the second place, there are African parallels
which suggest that the earliest agriculture in the Nile
valley and Mesopotamia could also have proceeded
without irrigation. The conditions in these river valleys
in antiquity resembled closely those found nowadays
on the Blue Nile, where semi-Hamitic nomads, the
Hadendoa, sow and harvest in the simple manner
which we shall now describe. It is possible, therefore,
to postulate similar simple methods for the prehistoric
Egyptians. Burckhardt renders his observations in the
Taka country of Nubia as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About the latter end of June ... large torrents coming
from the South and South-east pour over the country and
in the space of a few weeks cover the whole surface with
a sheet of water, varying in depth from two to three feet....
The waters, on subsiding, leave a thick slime, or mud,
upon the surface, similar to that left by the Nile....
Immediately after the inundation is imbibed, the Beduins
sow the seed upon the alluvial mud, without any previous
preparation whatever. The inundation is usually accompanied
by heavy downpours. The rains last several weeks
longer than the inundation but they are not incessant, falling
in heavy showers at short intervals.</p>
<p>The people appear to be ignorant of tillage. They have
no regular fields; and the Dhourra, their only grain, is sown
among the thorny trees and tents, by dibbling large holes
in the ground, into each of which a handful of the seed is
thrown. After the harvest is gathered, the peasants return
to their pastoral occupations; they seem never to have
thought of irrigating the ground for a second crop with
the water which might everywhere be found by digging
wells. Not less than four-fifths of the ground remains unsown;
but as the quantity of Dhourra produced is generally
sufficient ... they never think of making any provisions
for increasing it, notwithstanding that, when the inundation
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
is not copious, or only partial (no one remembers it
ever failing entirely) they suffer all the misery of want.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of procedure could not, of course, have been
invented in Palestine and Syria where rivers with regularly
recurring inundations are unknown. However,
the same results can be achieved where there are
copious spring rains. Newberry says of the Alabdeh
(Hamites living between the Nile valley and the Red
Sea): &ldquo;Some of these nomads sow a little barley or
millet after a rainstorm, and then pitch their tents for
a while till the grain grows, ripens and can be gathered.
Then they move on again with their little
flocks.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>There are, then, many ways in which a temporary
abundance of water can be utilized by simple people
to produce crops, and it may well be that the systematic
distribution of water which marks the agriculture
of historical times in Egypt and Mesopotamia did not
exist in prehistoric times at all. We shall see that the
problem of drainage was at first as important as that
of irrigation, or rather more so; in this respect the
modern analogies do not hold good.</p>
<p>The uncertainty attached to the earliest phases of
agriculture makes it impossible to speculate on the immediate
social consequences of the invention of food
production. One would expect these to consist in a
greater emphasis on local rather than tribal groupings,
a limitation of outlook and horizon, a progressive differentiation
of separate settlements as a result of their
attachment to the soil. But the introduction of agriculture
probably did not mean the more or less speedy
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
transition to a fully settled life or to a socio-political
organization on a large scale.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> Nor did it mean that all
the other ways of finding sustenance were neglected.
A &ldquo;partial exploitation of the environment&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> is characteristic
of modern savages who have become stuck in
a backwater, but not of the true primitives of antiquity.
The Natufians may have sown a catch crop or gathered
wild grasses, but they also hunted deer and speared
fish. All the early settlements of the Near East show
signs of a many-sided economy, although in all of them
agriculture played an important part. In all of them,
too, we find stock-breeding; and this is an innovation
which we must simply take for granted since its origin
and motivation is at present quite obscure.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> The
Natufians did not possess domestic animals.</p>
<p>Other inventions, too, were known throughout the
Near East in the earliest settlements of the New Stone
Age. Pottery-making is one of them, weaving another.
It is hardly to be wondered that we cannot follow the
first phases of their existence. If the earliest pots, for
instance, were only dried in the sun or lightly baked
or were merely clay-lined baskets, they cannot be expected
to have survived. And it may be considered
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
exceptionally fortunate that of early textiles a few
scraps have survived for six or seven thousand years.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a>
It is likewise only due to the refinements of modern
excavation technique that the oldest of the successive
settlements of Hassuna, near Mosul (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>), was
recognized as a camp site, consisting of no more than
a number of hearths, still containing wood ashes. They
were made of &ldquo;potsherds and pebbles set in a kind of
primitive cement&rdquo; with pottery lying around them.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>
Only in higher levels did adobe walls appear. This
single instance in which a very early settlement was
recognized explains why others remain unknown.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a>
But we know that after (or during) the time of the
Natufians these important discoveries were made and
diffused among villages stretching from the Nile valley
through the Delta and thence in a great arch (<a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>)
from Jericho in the south, via Byblos and Ras Shamra
on the Syrian coast to Mersin in Cilicia; then, through
the Amuq plain, east of Antioch, via Carchemish on
the Euphrates to Tell Halaf and Chagar Bazar in
North Syria to Nineveh and Hassuna near Mosul, and
on eastwards, to Sialk near Kashan in central Persia.</p>
<p>Throughout this region we find small self-contained
and self-supporting settlements. Some beads, shells, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
other luxuries may have been imported from more or
less distant regions by means of hand-to-hand barter.
Occasionally a rare raw material, such as obsidian&mdash;volcanic
glass, flaked and used, like flint, for tools&mdash;was
obtained regularly from outside. For the rest, one gets
an impression of a somewhat stagnant prosperity in
which the great new inventions were thoroughly exploited
but little changed from generation to generation
for a very long time. There are differences in the
crafts: flint tools, pot designs (even ceramic techniques),
and personal ornaments differ from region to
region and even, as in prehistoric Thessaly, from village
to village. There are also changes in style in the
course of time. But these local and temporal differences
must not detain us as we survey the prehistory
of the ancient Near East with a view to the subsequent
development. For that purpose we can divide the
region into three parts: the two great river valleys and
the area between, in which the rich plains of North
Syria were the most important part. This central area
was prosperous, but it remained unprogressive until
the second millennium, dependent on the great cultural
centres in Egypt and Mesopotamia. For that
reason, we shall confine our attention to the river
valleys.</p>
<p>Modern Egypt, even if we disregard the aridity of
its climate, differs entirely from the land with which
we are here concerned. Nowadays the whole of the
country is so intensively cultivated that it does not
possess sufficient grazing for its cattle, and one sees
cows, buffaloes and asses tethered at the desert edge
and fed on cultivated crops such as clover. The river
is thoroughly controlled. The desert valleys&mdash;wadis&mdash;are
devoid of vegetation except for bushes of camel-thorn.
But in prehistoric, as well as in Pharaonic times,
Egypt was a land of marshes in which papyrus, sedge,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and rushes grew to more than man&rsquo;s height (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>).
The wadis, too, teemed with life; they are best described
as park land where as late as the New Kingdom
(1400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) man could hunt Barbary sheep, wild
oxen, and asses, and a wide variety of antelopes with
their attendant carnivores. It has been pointed out<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a>
that the methods of hunting prove that different types
of landscape could be found here. Sometimes rows of
beaters are shown driving the game towards the
hunter or into nets, a method possible only in areas
which are somewhat thickly wooded. At other times
lassos are used, which presuppose pampa-like open
spaces with low shrub.</p>
<p>In the valley, the annual flood of the Nile continuously
changed the lay of the land. When the water
overflowed the river banks the silt, previously kept in
suspension by the speed of the swollen current, precipitated.
Some of this precipitation raised the river bed,
the remainder covered the banks and the area closest
to them; towards the edges of the valley there was
comparatively little deposit. Thus banks of considerable
height were formed, and after some years the
weight of water broke through these natural dikes to
seek a new course in low-lying parts, some distance
away. The old bed turned into swamp, but its banks
remained as ridges and hillocks whose height and area
were increased by wind-blown dust and silt caught at
their edges. Trees took root, and man settled there,
sowing his crops and grazing his beasts in the adjoining
lowlands, to retire with them to the high ground
of the old banks when the river overflowed. During
the inundation, fish, wild boar, hippopotamus, and
huge flocks of water birds invaded the surrounding
fields and supplied an abundance of food throughout
the summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>All traces of these settlements in the valley proper
have long since disappeared; they have been not
merely silted over but washed away by the changes in
the river&rsquo;s course.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> This explains why we find traces of
early settlements only at the edge of the valley, on the
spurs of detritus at the foot of the high cliffs. We must
imagine the valley, not flat and featureless as it is to-day,
but dotted with hamlets perched on the high
banks of former watercourses and surrounded by an
ever-changing maze of channels, marsh, and meadow.
Even as late as the First Intermediate period, just before
2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the populace of a province in Middle
Egypt left their homes and hid in swamps in the
valley to escape the dangers of civil war and marauding
soldiers.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> And the early predynastic settlements at
the valley&rsquo;s edge were built in groves; among the remains
of huts and shelters, tree roots of considerable
size have been found.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>The prehistoric, &ldquo;predynastic,&rdquo; period of Egypt
clearly falls into two parts or stages (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). The
earliest of these is known in three successive phases
called Tasian, Badarian, and Amratian,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> each a modified
development of its predecessor. Together they
represent the African substratum of Pharaonic civilization,
the material counterpart of the affinities between
ancient Egyptian and modern Hamitic languages; of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the physical resemblances between the ancient Egyptians
and the modern Hamites; and of the remarkable
similarities in mentality between these two groups
which make it possible to understand ancient Egyptian
customs and beliefs by reference to modern Hamitic
analogies.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> The second stage of predynastic culture&mdash;called
Gerzean<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a>&mdash;is in many ways a continuation of
Amratian; in other words, the preponderantly African
character remained. But new elements were added,
and these point to fairly close relations with the East,
with Sinai, and with Palestine. Foreign pottery was
imported from that quarter. A new type of Egyptian
pottery, implying a change in ceramic technique, was
derived from a class of wavy-handled vases which
were at home in Palestine. Several new kinds of stone
used for vases may have come from Sinai,<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> and the increase
in the use of copper points certainly to closer
relations with that peninsula. Although flint remained
in use and flint-work achieved an unrivalled beauty
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
and refinement, copper was no longer an odd substance
used for luxuries but appeared in the form of
highly practical objects: harpoons, daggers, axes (one
of which weighs 3&frac12; pounds).<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> The language of the
country may also have been affected.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>The innovations of Gerzean can best be explained as
the effect of a permeation of Upper Egypt by people
who had affinities with their Asiatic neighbours and
derived from them certain features of their culture.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a>
We know that in historical times a similar gradual but
continuous drift of people from Lower Egypt into
Upper Egypt can be observed.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> During the Gerzean
period the country seems to have become more densely
populated; and it has been suggested that the reclamation
of the marshland was begun.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> Such work presupposes
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
co-operation between neighbouring groups and
organization of men in some numbers. We may assume
that this took place, but on a strictly limited scale. For
there are no signs of large political units. There are no
ruins of great size, no monuments of an exceptional
nature; and if it is objected that these may have existed
but may not have been discovered yet, we must
insist on the significant fact that among the many thousands
of predynastic graves which have been found,
there is not a single one which by its size or equipment
suggests the burial of a great chief.<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a> The Gerzean innovation
did not change the general character of the
country&rsquo;s culture; the remains suggest a prosperous
homogeneous population, fully exploiting its rich environment
and loosely organized in villages and rural
districts. It was in this setting that the efflorescence of
Pharaonic civilization occurred.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia the corresponding change took
place in the extreme south, in the marshy plain between
the head of the Persian Gulf and the higher
ground which stretches north from Samarra and Hit.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a>
This older diluvial part of the country had been farmed
already for many centuries before the south was inhabited.
The northern farmers had passed through
three phases which can be distinguished by their material
equipment (see <a href="#c8">chronological table</a> at end of
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
book).<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> When the third was predominant in the
north, men from the Persian plateau entered the southern
marshes. Under present conditions it would be inconceivable
that highlanders would elect to do so, or
even that they would be able to survive there. But in
the fifth and fourth millennia <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Iranian plateau
had not yet become a salt desert. Many rivers, descending
from the surrounding mountains, ended in
upland seas without an outlet and ringed by swamps.
Even to-day, in eastern Iran, marsh dwellers are found
on the shores of the great lake of the river Hamun.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a>
Like the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq, they build
boats and huts of reeds, fish and keep water buffaloes
and cattle. Similar conditions must have prevailed over
much of Persia in the period we are discussing, and
immigrants from such regions would be well prepared
to face life in the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris.</p>
<p>The pottery made by the earliest settlers of South
Mesopotamia shows that they came from Persia. At
first they retained the tightly interwoven geometric
designs used in their homeland;<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> but left to themselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
they soon adopted an easier flowing, careless
decoration (called Al Ubaid) which remained in use
for many centuries and represents the Persian tradition
in only a very debased form. In many places it is found
on virgin soil, which shows that the settlers spread
farther through the country of which they had at first
occupied only certain localities. At Ur, for instance,
detailed observations were made which reveal the
conditions in which men lived when the site was first
inhabited. The relevant layers show:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a stratum of irregular thickness composed of refuse resulting
from human occupation&mdash;ashes, disintegrated mud
brick, potsherds, etc. This went down almost to sea-level;
below it was a belt about one metre thick of mud, grey
in colour above, and darkening to black below, much of
which was clearly due to the decay of vegetation. In it
were potsherds, sporadic above but becoming more numerous
lower down and massed thickly at the bottom, all
the fragments lying horizontally; they had the appearance
of having sunk by their own weight through water into
soft mud. At a metre below sea-level came stiff, green clay
pierced by sinuous brown stains resulting from the decay
of roots; with this all trace of human activity ceased. Evidently
this was the bottom of Mesopotamia.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></p>

<p>Southern Mesopotamia resembled the Egyptian
Delta, rather than the Nile valley where cliffs constrain
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
the meanderings of the river, and old banks and
spurs provide high ground. In Mesopotamia the lowest
course of Euphrates and Tigris presents, even to-day,
a wilderness of reed forests where the Marsh
Arabs lead an amphibious existence (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>). All traffic
is by narrow bituminous skiffs; the people fish and
keep some cattle, living in reed huts built on mattresses
of bent and trodden-down reed stems. Their dwellings
are described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at one end is a low and narrow aperture which serves as a
doorway, window and chimney combined; on the rush-strewn
and miry floor sleep men and women, children and
buffaloes, in warm proximity ... the ground of the hut
often oozing water at every step.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chiefs&rsquo; reed tents are more impressive; they are
large tunnels of matting covering a framework of reed
bundles which form semicircular arches. Doors and
windows are arranged in the mats closing either end.
We know that such structures were also used in the
fourth millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span>, for they are represented, with
all the necessary detail, in the earliest renderings of
sacred buildings, notably the byres and folds of
temple animals (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>
<p>But modern savages are but diminished shadows of
the true primitives, and the ancient people of the Al
Ubaid period exercised a mastery over the marsh to
which the modern inhabitants never as much as aspire.
Moreover, the people of the Al Ubaid period belonged
to the most advanced group of the prehistoric farmers.
Copper was used in their homeland for axes and adzes
and even for mirrors. Bricks were known there, too;
and brick buildings and the waterproofing of reeds
with bitumen are certified for the period. It is likely
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
that some reclamation and drainage of marshland was
undertaken. In any case, the men of the Al Ubaid
period appear from the first as cultivators, and we are
free to imagine their fields as shallow islands in the
marsh or as reclaimed and diked-in land.</p>
<p>The vitality and power of these earliest settlers is
astonishing. Their influence can be traced upstream,
where their pottery replaced the Tell Halaf wares
completely, even occurring in appreciable quantities
in North Syria. Since it has nothing to recommend it
as an article of export, we must assume that its makers
came with it and settled widely throughout the upper
reaches of Tigris and Euphrates. Nevertheless, the Al
Ubaid people were simple cultivators like their contemporaries
in Egypt and their predecessors in northern
Iraq and Syria. This is most clearly shown by their
inability to organize trade in order to obtain the
copper which they had been accustomed to use in their
country of origin. Once settled in Mesopotamia and
removed from the sources of the metal, they used a
substitute material that was locally available, making
axes (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a><i>a</i>), choppers, and sickles (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a><i>b</i>) of clay
which they fired at so high a temperature that it almost
vitrified and thus obtained a useful cutting edge.
These implements were, of course, very brittle and
were broken by the hundreds. But they could be easily
replaced; and the isolated settlements achieved that
autarchy which is characteristic of early peasant cultures.</p>
<p>And yet the Al Ubaid period has left us some remains
which suggest that certain centres began to be
of outstanding importance and that a change in the
rural character of the settlements was taking place. At
Abu Shahrein in the south,<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> and at Tepe Gawra in
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the north, temples were erected. And these not only
testify to a co-ordinated effort on a larger scale than we
would expect within the scope of a village culture, but
show also a number of features which continue in historical
times&mdash;for instance: the simple oblong shape of
the sanctuary, with its altar and offering table; the
platforms on which the temples were set; the strengthening
buttresses (which developed into a system of
piers and recesses, rhythmically articulating the walls).
Moreover, it is likely that at Eridu there was continuity,
not only of architectural development, but of
worship. In the absence of inscriptions this contention
cannot be proved. But the god worshipped there in
historical times was called Enki&mdash;lord of the earth, but
also god of the sweet waters. He is depicted surrounded
by waters (for he &ldquo;had founded his chamber
in the deep&rdquo;) and fishes sport in the streams which
spring from his shoulders. Now an observation made
during the excavation of the Al Ubaid temples suggests
that the same god was adored in them. At one
stage the offering table and sanctuary were covered
with a layer of fish bones six inches deep, remains, no
doubt, of an offering to the god of whom it was said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When Enki rose, the fishes rose and adored him.</p>
<p class="t0">He stood, a marvel unto the Apsu (Deep),</p>
<p class="t0">Brought joy to the Engur (Deep).</p>
<p class="t0">To the sea it seemed that awe was upon him,</p>
<p class="t0">To the Great River it seemed that terror hovered around him</p>
<p class="t0">While at the same time the south wind stirred the depths of the Euphrates.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The importance which one attaches to these signs of
a possible continuity remains a matter of personal
judgment. But, in any case, the Al Ubaid culture which
we have described was the first to have occupied
Mesopotamia as a whole. It seems to have spread along
the rivers from the south.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> And it was in the south
that, after an interval, the profound change was
brought about which made first Sumer, and then
Babylon, the cultural centre of Western Asia for three
thousand years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">III. THE CITIES OF MESOPOTAMIA</span></h2>
<p>The scene we have so far surveyed has been somewhat
monotonous. The differences between the various
groups of prehistoric farmers are insignificant beside
the overriding similarity of their mode of life, relatively
isolated as they were and almost entirely self-sufficient
in their small villages. But by the middle of
the fourth millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span> this picture changed, first in
Mesopotamia and a little later in Egypt; and the
change may be described in terms of archaeological
evidence. In Mesopotamia we find a considerable increase
in the size of settlements and buildings such as
temples. For the first time we can properly speak of
monumental architecture as a dominant feature of sizable
cities. In Egypt, too, monumental architecture appeared;
and in both countries writing was introduced,
new techniques were mastered, and representational
art&mdash;as distinct from the mainly decorative art of the
preceding period&mdash;made its first appearance.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the change was not a
quantitative one. If one stresses the increased food
supply or the expansion of human skill and enterprise;
or if one combines both elements by proclaiming irrigation
a triumph of skill which produced abundance;
even if one emphasizes the contrast between the circumscribed
existence of the prehistoric villagers and
the richer, more varied, and more complex life in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
cities&mdash;one misses the point. All these quantitative
evaluations lead to generalizations which obscure the
very problem with which we are concerned. For a
comparison between Egypt and Mesopotamia discloses,
not only that writing, representational art,
monumental architecture, and a new kind of political
coherence were introduced in the two countries; it
also reveals the striking fact that the purpose of their
writing, the contents of their representations, the functions
of their monumental buildings, and the structure
of their new societies differed completely. What we
observe is not merely the establishment of civilized
life, but the emergence, concretely, of the distinctive
&ldquo;forms&rdquo; of Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization.</p>
<p>It is necessary to anticipate here and to substantiate
the contrast. The earliest written documents of Mesopotamia
served a severely practical purpose; they
facilitated the administration of large economic units,
the temple communities. The earliest Egyptian inscriptions
were legends on royal monuments or seal
engravings identifying the king&rsquo;s officials. The earliest
representations in Mesopotamian art are preponderantly
religious; in Egyptian art they celebrate royal
achievements and consist of historical subjects. Monumental
architecture consists, in Mesopotamia, of
temples, in Egypt of royal tombs. The earliest civilized
society of Mesopotamia crystallized in separate nuclei,
a number of distinct, autonomous cities&mdash;clear-cut, self-assertive
polities&mdash;with the surrounding lands to sustain
each one. Egyptian society assumed the form of
the single, united, but rural, domain of an absolute
monarch.</p>
<p>The evidence from Egypt, which is the more extensive,
indicates the transition was neither slow nor
gradual. It is true that towards the end of the prehistoric
period certain innovations heralded the coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
age. But when the change occurred it had the
character of a crisis, affecting every aspect of life at
once but passing within the space of a few generations.
Then followed&mdash;from the middle of the First until the
end of the Third Dynasty&mdash;a period of consolidation
and experiment, and with this the formative phase of
Egyptian civilization was concluded. Few things that
mattered in Pharaonic Egypt were without roots in
that first great age of creativity.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia a parallel development possessed a
somewhat different character. It likewise affected
every field of cultural activity at once, but it lacked
the finality of its Egyptian counterpart. It cannot be
said of Mesopotamia that its civilization evolved in all
its significant aspects from the achievements of one
short period, decisive as that had been. Mesopotamian
history shows a succession of upheavals, at intervals
of but a few centuries, which did more than modify its
political complexion. For instance, the Sumerian
language,<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a>
which was dominant throughout the formative
phase of Mesopotamian civilization, was replaced by
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Semitic Akkadian during the second half of the third
millennium. And the shift of the centre of power, in
the third millennium, from Sumer in the extreme
south to Babylonia in the centre, in the second millennium
to Assyria, in the extreme north, brought with it
important cultural changes. Yet notwithstanding all
the changes, Mesopotamian civilization never lost its
identity; its &ldquo;form&rdquo; was modified by its turbulent history,
but it was never destroyed.</p>
<p>We shall now desist from comparisons and consider
the formative age of Mesopotamia, which is called the
Protoliterate period since it witnessed the invention of
writing. To this period the earliest ruins of cities belong.
Now one may say that the birth of Mesopotamian
civilization, like its subsequent growth, occurred under
the sign of the city. To understand the importance of
the city as a factor in the shaping of society, one must
not think of it as a mere conglomeration of people.
Most modern cities have lost the peculiar characteristic
of individuality which we can observe in cities of
Renaissance Italy, of Medieval Europe, of Greece, and
of Mesopotamia. In these counties the physical existence
of the city is but an outward sign of close communal
affinities which dominate the life of every
dweller within the walls. The city sets its citizens apart
from the other inhabitants of the land. It determines
their relations with the outside world. It produces an
intensified self-consciousness in its burghers, to whom
the collective achievements are a source of pride. The
communal life of prehistoric times became civic life.</p>
<p>The change, however, was not without its disadvantages,
especially in a country like Mesopotamia.
The modest life of the prehistoric villager had fitted
well enough into the natural surroundings, but the
city was a questionable institution, at variance, rather
than in keeping, with the natural order. This fact was
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
brought home by the frequent floods and storms,
droughts and marsh-fires with which the gods destroyed
man&rsquo;s work. For in Mesopotamia, in contrast
with Egypt, natural conditions did not favour the development
of civilization. Sudden changes could bring
about conditions beyond man&rsquo;s control.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> Spring tides
in the Persian Gulf may rise to a height of eight to
nine feet; prolonged southerly gales may bank up the
rivers for as much as two feet or more. Abnormal
snowfalls in Armenia, or abnormal rainfall farther to
the south, may cause a sudden rise of level in the rivers;
a landslide in the narrow gorges of the two Zabs
or of the Khabur may first hold up, then suddenly release,
an immense volume of water. Any one of these
circumstances, or the simultaneous occurrence of two
or more of them, may create a flow which the earth
embankments in the southern plain are not able to
contain. In prehistoric times when primitive farmers
sowed a catch crop after the inundation, it was possible
to adapt human settlement to the ever-changing
distribution of land and water, even though the villages
were frequently destroyed. But large permanent
towns, dependent upon drainage and irrigation, require
unchanging watercourses. This can be achieved
only through relentless vigilance and toil; for the
quickly running Tigris carries so coarse a silt that
canals easily get blocked. Even when cleaned annually,
they rise gradually above the plain as a result
of precipitation; and the risk that they, or the rivers
themselves, may burst through their banks is never excluded.
In 1831 the Tigris, rising suddenly, broke its
embankment and destroyed 7000 houses in Baghdad
in a single night.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Small wonder, then, that the boldness of those early
people who undertook to found permanent settlements
in the shifting plain had its obverse in anxiety; that the
self-assertion which the city&mdash;its organization, its institutions,
citizenship itself&mdash;implied was overshadowed
by apprehension. The tension between courage
and the awareness of man&rsquo;s dependence on superhuman
power found a precarious equilibrium in a
peculiarly Mesopotamian conception. It was a conception
which was elaborated in theology but which
likewise informed the practical organization of society:
the city was conceived to be ruled by a god.</p>
<p>Theocracy, of course, was not peculiar to Mesopotamia:
Egypt, too, was ruled by a god. But this god
was incarnate in Pharaoh; and whatever may be paradoxical
in a belief in the divinity of kings, it at least
leaves no doubt as to the ultimate authority in the state
and subjects the people unreservedly to the ruler&rsquo;s
command. In Mesopotamia no god was identified with
the mortal head of the state. The world of the gods
and the world of men were incommensurate. Nevertheless,
a god was supposed to own the city and its
people. The temple was called the god&rsquo;s house; and it
functioned actually as the manor-house on an estate,
with the community labouring in its service. We shall
describe the organization of the temple community at
the end of this chapter. It is necessary first to survey
the actual remains of the Protoliterate cities&mdash;the earliest
cities in Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>In Protoliterate ruins the temples are the most striking
feature. We have seen how, in the Al Ubaid period,
temples were erected at Eridu in the south and at Tepe
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Gawra in the north. But the edifices of the Protoliterate
period at Erech are much more impressive. The temple
of the god Anu (Figs. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig45">45</a>) was placed upon an artificial
mound forty feet high and covering an area of
about 420,000 square feet. It dominated the plain for
many miles around. Near its base lay another great
shrine, dedicated to the goddess Inanna. Several times
changed and rebuilt, it measured, at one stage, 240 by
110 feet; at another it possessed a colonnade in which
each column measured 9 feet in diameter (Figs. <a href="#fig9">9</a>, <a href="#fig10">10</a>).
Each of these, and also the adjoining walls and the
sides of the platform supporting them, was covered
with a weatherproof &ldquo;skin&rdquo; consisting of tens of thousands
of clay cones, separately made, baked, and coloured.
These formed patterns of lozenges, zigzags, and
triangles, and so on, in black and red on a buff ground.
The cones were stuck into a thick mud plaster which
covered the brickwork. The patterning in colour enlivened
a fa&ccedil;ade already richly articulated by complex
systems of buttresses, recesses, and semi-engaged columns,
and thus achieved an effect far beyond anything
which the exclusive use of mud as building material
would suggest as attainable.</p>
<p>The most characteristic feature of Mesopotamian
temple architecture was the artificial mound, called a
ziggurat or temple tower (Figs. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig11">11</a>), the tower of
Babel being the best known, that of Ur the best preserved,
example. However, ziggurats were not found
in connection with all temples. The Protoliterate
temple at Tell Uqair, which has the same plan and
even the same dimensions as the contemporary temple
on the ziggurat at Erech, stands on a platform only a
few metres high.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> I am inclined to see in this an abbreviated
rendering of the ziggurat, but the possibility
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
that the two differed in significance cannot be excluded.
We cannot explain why some temples should
lack ziggurats; but we can understand why so many
great shrines were equipped with them, and why the
staggering communal effort which their construction
entailed was undertaken.</p>
<p>The significance of the ziggurats is revealed by the
names which many of them bear, names which identify
them as mountains. That of the god Enlil at Nippur,
for example, was called &ldquo;House of the Mountain,
Mountain of the Storm, Bond between Heaven and
Earth.&rdquo; Now &ldquo;mountain,&rdquo; as used in Mesopotamia, is
a term so heavily charged with religious significance
that a simple translation does it as little justice as it
would to the word &ldquo;Cross&rdquo; in Christian, or the words
&ldquo;West&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nun&rdquo; (Primeval Ocean) in Egyptian,
usage.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> In Mesopotamia the &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; is the place
where the mysterious potency of the earth, and hence
of all natural life, is concentrated. This is perhaps best
understood if we look at a rather rough relief of terra
cotta (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12</a>) which was found at Assur in a temple
of the second millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span>, although similar representations
are known on seals of a much earlier date.
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
The deity represented is clearly a personification of
chthonic forces. His body grows out of a mountain
(the scale pattern is the conventional rendering of a
mountainside), and the plants grow from the mountainsides
as well as from the god&rsquo;s hands. Goats feed
on these plants; and water, indispensable to all life, is
represented by two minor deities flanking the god.
Deities like the main figure on this relief were worshipped
in all Mesopotamian cities, although their
names differed. Tammuz is the best known of them. As
personifications of natural life they were thought to be
incapacitated during the Mesopotamian summer,
which is a scourge destroying vegetation utterly and
exhausting man and beast. The myths express this by
saying that the god &ldquo;dies&rdquo; or that he is kept captive in
the &ldquo;mountain.&rdquo; From the mountain he comes forth
at the New Year when nature revives. Hence, the
mountain is also the land of the dead; and when the
sun god is depicted rising daily upon the mountains of
the East, the scene is not merely a reminder of the
geography of the country. The vivifying rain is also
brought from the mountain by the weather god. Thus
the mountain is essentially the mysterious sphere of
activity of the superhuman powers. The Sumerians created
the conditions under which communication with
the gods became possible when they erected the artificial
mountains for their temples.</p>
<p>In doing so they also strengthened their political
cohesion. The huge building, raised to establish a
bond with the power upon which the city depended,
proclaimed not only the ineffable majesty of the gods
but also the might of the community which had been
capable of such an effort. The great temples were witnesses
to piety, but also objects of civic pride. Built to
ensure divine protection for the city, they also enhanced
the significance of citizenship. Outlasting the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
generation of their builders, they were true monuments
of the cities&rsquo; greatness.</p>
<p>It is in these temples that we find the first signs of a
new invention without which the undertaking of works
of this magnitude, or, indeed, of communal organization
on a considerable scale, would not have been
feasible, that is, writing.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> From the first it appears in
the form of impressions made by a reed on clay tablets.
The earliest of the tablets, found in the temple at
Erech, were memoranda&mdash;aids for the running of the
temple as the production centre, warehouse, and workshop
of the community. The simplest were no more
than tallies with a few numerals. Others bear, besides
the numerals, impressions of cylinder seals to identify
the parties or witnesses to the transactions recorded.
Still others indicate the object of the transaction. For
instance, a simple inscription may consist of the entry:
so many sheep, so many goats. There even occurs a
more complex type, namely, a wage-list with a series
of entries&mdash;presumably personal names&mdash;followed by
the indication &ldquo;beer and bread for one day.&rdquo; There is
no reason to assume (as has usually been done) that
these earliest tablets represent the last stage of a long
development; the script appears from the first as a
system of conventional signs&mdash;partly arbitrary tokens,
partly pictograms&mdash;such as might well have been introduced
all at once (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). We are confronted with
a true invention, not with an adaptation of pictorial
art.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>As regards the art of the Protoliterate period, the
vast majority of the extant works deals with religious
matters. Sometimes ritual acts were depicted, sometimes
an ornamental pattern was built up of religious
symbols; and occasionally it is impossible to be certain
whether the one or the other was intended. But the
reference is, in all cases, to the gods. Among the symbols&mdash;on
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
seals<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> and in the mural decoration of temples&mdash;plants
and animals, especially those upon which man
depends for his livelihood, were by far the most frequent.
These were the emblems of the great goddess
worshipped at Erech and throughout the land. They
occur singly or in combination (for instance an ear of
barley and a bull [<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>; cf. <a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>]), the vegetable
kingdom often being represented by rosettes. Friezes
of sheep or cattle covered the walls of the Protoliterate
temples&mdash;painted at Uqair, inlaid or carved in stone at
Erech (Figs. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <a href="#fig18">18</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> Implements used in the cult,
such as stands for offerings, were likewise decorated
with animals, as were also sacred vessels: a trough
(<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), from which the temple flock was presumably
fed, shows sheep near their fold&mdash;a reed structure
(<i>srefe</i>) like those still built by the Marsh Arabs in
southern Iraq (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>); and the building is crowned
by two curiously bound reed bundles which correspond
to the oldest form of the sign with which the
name of the mother-goddess was written. Vases and
seal designs showing the performance of ritual acts
(Figs. <a href="#fig15">15</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>) are also common. Like the symbols used
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
in decorative art, these acts point consistently to the
worship of deities manifest in nature.</p>
<p>The gods were also symbols of a collective identity.
Each city projected its sovereignty into the deity
which it conceived as its owner. There seems to be a
contradiction here: the nature gods whom the Protoliterate
monuments celebrate would seem more suitable
for worship by countrymen and farmers than by
townsmen as we know them. But our contrast &ldquo;town
versus country&rdquo; is misleading.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> While it is true that
the city in Mesopotamia was an outstanding innovation
of the Protoliterate period, the great divergence
between city and countryside, between rural and
urban life, is, in the form in which we are familiar
with it, a product of the &ldquo;industrial revolution,&rdquo; and
emphasis on this contrast mars our perspective when
we view earlier situations.</p>
<p>About 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span> roughly three-quarters of the Athenian
burghers owned some land in Attica,<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> and as
recently as the European Middle Ages our contrast
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
&ldquo;urban-rural&rdquo; was unknown. At that time the city was
as distinct a social institution as it has ever been, but
it was intimately related with the land. Trevelyan
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Fourteenth Century the English town was still a
rural and agricultural community as well as a centre of industry
and commerce ... outside lay the &ldquo;townfields,&rdquo;
unenclosed by hedges, where each citizen-farmer cultivated
his own strips of cornland; and each grazed his cattle
and sheep on the common pasture of the town.... In
1388 it was laid down by Parliamentary Statute that in
harvest-time journeymen and apprentices should be called
on to lay aside their crafts and should be compelled &ldquo;to
cut, gather and bring in the corn&rdquo;; mayors, bailiffs and
constables of towns were to see this done.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Mesopotamia, then, many of the townspeople
worked their own fields. And the life of all was regulated
by a calendar which harmonized society&rsquo;s progress
through the year with the succession of the
seasons. A recurring sequence of religious festivals interrupted
all business and routine at frequent intervals;
several days in each month were set aside for the
celebration of the completion by the moon of one of
its phases, and of other natural occurrences. The greatest
annual event in each city, which might last as long
as twelve days, was the New Year&rsquo;s festival, celebrated
at the critical point of the farmer&rsquo;s year when nature&rsquo;s
vitality was at a low ebb and everything depended
upon a turn of the tide. Society, involved to the extent
of its very life, could not passively await the outcome
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
of the conflict between the powers of death and revival.
With great emotional intensity it participated by
ritual acts in the vicissitudes of the gods in whom were
personified the generative forces of nature. The mood
of these urban celebrations, as late as Assyrian and
Neo-Babylonian times, shows that the main issue was
still the maintenance of the bond with nature.</p>
<p>We do not know for what reasons certain of the
nature gods became connected with a given city. We
only know that the city, as soon as it became recognizable,
appears as the property of one god, although
other deities were worshipped there as well. The city
god was sometimes viewed as an absentee landlord,
always difficult of approach and apt to express himself
somewhat casually in signs and portents, dreams and
omens of dubious meaning. Yet a misunderstanding of
the commands thus conveyed was likely to provoke the
calamity of divine anger.</p>
<p>It is in keeping with the tenor of Mesopotamian religiosity
at all times that the relationship between the
city and its divine owner could be conceived only as
one of complete dependence.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> Throughout we meet
with the sombre conviction that man is impotently exposed
to the impact of a turbulent and unpredictable
universe. This feeling was rationalized in theology,
which taught that man was created especially to serve
the convenience of the gods. In the <i>Epic of Creation</i>
man was brought into being after Marduk, the creator,
had remarked casually:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let him be burdened with the toil of the gods that they
may freely breathe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same view is implied in an older, Sumerian, myth
in which Enlil breaks the earth&rsquo;s crust with a pickaxe
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
so that men may sprout forth like plants. And the
other gods surround Enlil and beg him to allot to
them serfs from among the Sumerians who are breaking
forth from the earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<p>The belief that man fulfilled the purpose of his being
by serving the gods had very remarkable consequences
for the structure of early Sumerian society.
Since the citizens projected the sovereignty of their
community into their god, they were all equal in his
service. In practice this service took the form of a co-operative
effort which was minutely organized. The
result was a planned society, and the remains of the
Protoliterate period show that it existed then, although
it is better known from Early Dynastic times.<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a></p>
<p>We must start by distinguishing two interlocking
but distinct social institutions. The political unit was
the city; the economic-religious unit the temple community.
Each temple owned lands which formed the
estate of its divine owners. Each citizen belonged to
one of the temples, and the whole of a temple community&mdash;the
officials and priests, herdsmen and fishermen,
gardeners, craftsmen, stone cutters, merchants,
and even slaves&mdash;was referred to as &ldquo;the people of the
god X.&rdquo; Ideally one can imagine one temple community
to have formed the original kernel of each
city; but whether this situation ever prevailed we do
not know, since the Early Dynastic tablets acquaint us
with cities comprising several temples with their
estates.<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Part of the temple land was actually worked by all
for all, or again, to put it in the terms of the ancients,
by all in the service of the god. This part of the land&mdash;not
more than one-fourth of the whole in a case we
can check&mdash;was called <i>nigenna</i>-land, a term which
may be translated &ldquo;Common,&rdquo; since the land involved
was cultivated by the community as a whole. A second
part, called <i>kur</i>-land, was divided into allotments
which were assigned to members of the community
for their support. A third part, called <i>Uru-lal</i>-land, was
let out to tenants at a rent amounting to from one-third
to one-sixth of the yield. Most of this rent could
be paid in grain, but a small part had to be paid in
silver.</p>
<p>The temple supplied the seed-corn, draft animals,
and implements for the cultivation of the Common;
and high and low worked every year in the &ldquo;fields of
the god,&rdquo; repairing the dikes and canals as a <i>corv&eacute;e</i>.
The <i>sangu</i>, or priest, who stood at the head of the
temple community assigned the shares in the communal
tasks. He appeared as bailiff of the god and was
assisted by a <i>nubanda</i>, or steward, who supervised
labour, magazines, and administration. Stores of grain
which had accumulated were not merely used for
seed-corn, nor were they exclusively at the disposal of
the priest, to be used for sacrifices and for the sustenance
of the temple personnel. The priests, like
everyone else, had their allotments to support themselves,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
and the fruits of communal labour returned in
part to the citizens in the form of rations of barley and
wool, which were distributed regularly, and extra
rations, supplied on feast days.</p>
<p>Although the amounts of rations were not equal, nor
the tasks assigned to all men equally burdensome, we
observe here a fact unparalleled in the ancient world,
namely, that in principle all members of the community
were equal. All received rations as well as allotments
to support themselves; all worked on the
Common and on the canals and dikes. There was no
leisure class. Likewise there were no native serfs. Some
foreigners and prisoners of war were kept as slaves, but
private people possessed very few, if any. Slaves
worked in the temple alongside free-men as porters
and gardeners. Slave girls were kept in considerable
numbers as spinners, and they helped in the kitchens,
the brewery, and the sties where pigs were fattened.</p>
<p>The allotments differed in size, even when assigned
to men of the same profession, and we cannot explain
the differences. There is no evidence of large estates
in the hands of single members of the temple community,
but we may suppose that the existence of several
temple communities in one city may have made it
possible for some men to dispose of allotments in more
than one of them. We know of a <i>nubanda</i> who had
about 120 acres and a supervisor of the herb magazines
who owned about 80 acres.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a> But such conditions
represent deviations from the original system. More
significant is the fact that even the smallest allotment
entered in the temple lists&mdash;a <i>gan</i>, or seven-eighths of
an acre&mdash;would suffice to keep a man. Monogamy and
the scarcity of slaves would, in any case, limit the area
which one family could cultivate.</p>
<p>Women are also listed as holders of allotments, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
this means that they served the community in some
function or other. For the basic rule of the temple
community was that a person received land for his
sustenance because he put his specialized skill at the
service of all: the shepherd and the fisherman, the carpenter
and the smith provided the temple magazines
with certain quantities of their produce or simply devoted
all their time to work on temple property.</p>
<p>The magazines (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> contained an immense
variety of articles: grain, sesame seed as the raw material
for oil, onions and other vegetables, beer, dates,
wine (which was rare), fish (dried or salted), fat,
wool, skins, huge quantities of reeds and rushes used
for ceilings and for torches, temporary structures, mats
for floor coverings and hangings, wood of many kinds,
asphalt (used wherever anything had to be waterproof),
valuable stones like marble and diorite, to be
made into statues and cult objects such as offering-stands,
ritual vessels, and the maceheads of the temple
guards. The stone, and some of the wood, was imported
by merchants, who also brought from Elam
aromatics which, in the &ldquo;oil house,&rdquo; were made into
ointments with a base of animal fat. Tools were owned
by the temple in great quantities and given out on
loan.</p>
<p>All these articles and materials were checked and
booked upon arrival and either stored or worked up
within the temple precincts. Carpenters made ploughs
and other implements, kept them in repair, and built
chariots, and probably ships. Tanners prepared skins
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
for harnesses and for leather bottles in which milk and
oil were kept. Wool was prepared, and part of it spun,
by slave girls; the Baba temple at Lagash employed
127 of these, with 30 of their children. But only 18
were spinners. The others cleaned and prepared the
wool, of which large quantities were used in the export
trade. A good deal was also distributed as rations to
the members of the community. The shearing of the
numerous sheep&mdash;or rather, the plucking of their wool&mdash;was
done in a special compound outside the temple
precincts, as was, likewise, the milling of the grain.</p>
<p>Barley constituted the main crop, but spelt and
emmer wheat were also grown. Monthly rations of
barley went from the granaries to the brewery and
kitchen of the temple. The brewers also took charge
of sheep and cattle to be fattened. But cattle were
scarce, for there was little rich meadow land for grazing.
The steppe in Iraq will sustain sheep in spring,
but the sun burns the grass early in the summer; and
even in antiquity the flocks had to be tided over the
worst period with grain. In some local calendars there
is a month &ldquo;in which barley is given to the sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The common protein food was fish rather than meat.
We have records of private fishponds, and fifty different
kinds of fishes are named in the texts. These also
distinguish river fishermen, canal fishermen, coast
fishermen, and fishermen of the high seas. Sheep and
goats were kept for milk and wool. Oxen were used
for ploughing, as were also asses. Both oxen and asses
were used in teams of four head and fed on barley.
The native breeds, deteriorating in the exhausting
climate of the plain, were periodically invigorated by
crossing with animals imported from Persia. Pigs were
kept in the marshes and were also fattened.</p>
<p>Beside extensive cane brakes the temple owned
&ldquo;woods&rdquo;; these consisted largely of date groves, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
there, between the palms, other plants were cultivated,
such as grapes, figs, pomegranates, and mulberries.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a>
Other groves consisted of timber trees, and there were
apple orchards where, it seems, the blind were put to
work.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a></p>
<p>The citizens, when working for the temple, were
organized in groups or guilds under their own foremen.
These divided the tasks among the members of
the group, were responsible for the delivery of the
produce, and received the rations for the group. Other
lists, enumerating the citizens liable for military service,
suggest that the men served guildwise with their
foremen as cadre. But there were also professional
soldiers, distinguished in two groups, spearmen and
shield-bearers. In peace time they worked on the Common,
harvested reeds in the cane brakes and assisted
in building operations.</p>
<p>The specialization and detailed division of labour of
the temple community, and especially the grouping of
all kinds of labourers under foremen responsible for
deliveries and receipt of rations, offered many opportunities
for oppression. But too much can be made of
the weaknesses of the system. To speak of the &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;
of food which must be produced in order to
maintain officials as well as merchants and craftsmen,
and to imply that the officials must have been a
parasitic class which kept the farmers in subjection,<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a>
leaves out of account several circumstances, of which
the most important is the climate of the country. Wherever
there is power there is, inevitably, abuse of
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
power. But the rich soil of Mesopotamia, if well watered,
produces food in abundance without excessive
or continuous toil. Labour in the fields was largely
seasonal. At seed time and harvest time every able-bodied
person was no doubt on the land, as was the
case in medieval England. But the farmers were not a
separate class or caste. Every citizen, whether priest,
merchant, or craftsman, was a practical farmer who
worked his allotment to support himself and his dependents.
Once the seed was sown and the harvest
gathered, plenty of time remained in which special
skills could be developed, taught, and exploited. There
are interesting analogies in villages of our own time,
where often enough a farmer or a labourer is a specialist
in some branch of craftsmanship. In Europe this
condition is rapidly disappearing and was never regularized;
but we may quote two modern African instances
which will make it easier for us to imagine how
practical husbandry and the exercise of crafts and
home industry can go together. The modern instances
differ, of course, in important details but are instructive
nevertheless. It is said about the Nuer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no specialized and hereditary trades though
certain persons may acquire a local reputation for skill in
making such things as pipes, collars for bulls, canoes or
ivory bracelets. These people are not craftsmen by trade,
and their activities centre round their cattle, like every
other Nuer. Their services are normally accepted by others
as part of the integral system of mutual aid which is the
basis of every Nuer community, and they are repaid by
assistance in pastoral or agricultural activities or by reciprocal
gifts.<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For another instance, with a rather peculiar character:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In West Africa the Pangwe do not make a business of
carving and weaving; all such work is done on the side, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the intervals of fishing and farming. But in so far as a man
does carve he is the narrowest of experts. He will manufacture
tools but will leave bows to his neighbour, and a
spoon carver would never attempt a ladle.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are reminded of the many names to designate fishermen
in Sumerian, even though specialization was
certainly less narrow in the Mesopotamian cities. But
the point I want to make is that, for all the guilds and
professional skills which we find there, the population
as a whole was concerned with the primary business
of tillage and cannot be compared with any modern
body of city dwellers.</p>
<p>Since a considerable proportion of agricultural and
other produce passed through the temple magazines,
an elaborate system of administration was set up. To
illustrate the kind of careful accounts kept of the expenses,
we shall quote a record of the grain used in a
certain operation. To understand it, it is necessary to
know that the fields were ploughed twice, first to break
up the ground, then to sow and cover the seed. For the
second ploughing a seed funnel was attached to the
plough to ensure an even distribution along the furrow.
Since the second ploughing was less heavy than
the breaking of the ground, the oxen used for it got
only half the fodder allotted to the teams used in the
first. (The Sumerian measures can be converted by
taking the <i>gan</i> at just under an acre and the <i>gur</i> at
about 3&#8531; bushels.)</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>This grain came from the temple magazines which had
been filled by the harvest of the Common.</p>
<p>In order to make it possible to draw up a budget,
the yield per acre was estimated, account being taken
of whether the land was good and arable, newly reclaimed,
swampy, or distant from water. The monthly
allowances of functionaries were listed, as were the
monthly supplies to brewery, bakery, and kitchen, and
the tasks allotted to the guilds of craftsmen, shepherds,
fishermen; and other specialized workers were also
listed in monthly quotas. All these documents were
signed by the <i>sangu</i> and the <i>nubanda</i>. But the absence
of money made simplification imperative, since the accounts
recorded a continual intake of all kinds of
goods, and the outflow of similarly varied stores, in
the form of rations, sacrifices, materials for repairs,
goods for trade, and so on&mdash;which were not reduced to
a common standard of value. It would have been impossible
to budget from month to month and from year
to year unless the book-keeping had been adapted to
a somewhat simple scheme with fixed ratios prevailing
throughout. The schematic character of the temple accounts
can be seen in the one instance which we
quoted above: the fodder for the sowing oxen was precisely
the same quantity as that used for seed. The
span used to break the ground received precisely twice
the amount allotted to the span following after with
the seed funnel. Similar simple ratios were used for
valuations: one <i>gur</i> of barley was reckoned equivalent
to one <i>gin</i> of silver; one <i>gur</i> of barley was likewise
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
charged as rent for one <i>gan</i> of land. It is obvious that
such equations reduced the innumerable calculations
of the temple book-keeping to manageable proportions.
But it is likewise obvious that these simplified
and rigid scales never corresponded to the actual
values of goods or services. The margin cannot have
worked consistently to the detriment of the people,
for then the system would have collapsed. Consequently,
the margin must have been disadvantageous
to the temple economy which could well afford it and
which was, in a way, the property of the people as a
whole. When in bad years deliveries of certain goods
fell short of the quantities due each month to the
temple magazines, debts arose and were duly booked
and were expected, ultimately, to be paid off. But, on
the whole, the organization of the temple economy
aimed at simplicity rather than efficiency; and in the
Sumerian city, although it was a &ldquo;planned society,&rdquo;
men found considerable scope for private enterprise.</p>
<p>The margin between the schematic values used in
dealings with the temple and the actual yield of fields,
flocks, and workshops must have given opportunities
for some accumulation of private wealth and hence for
barter. Craftsmen could utilize their special skills for
private commissions as long as they used materials not
supplied by the temple magazines. The shepherd could
dispose of any increase in his flock beyond the statutory
figure; the fisherman could dispose of the remainder
of his catch after delivering to the temple his
monthly quota. If, therefore, &ldquo;the people of the god
X&rdquo;&mdash;the temple community&mdash;can be said to have lived
under a system of theocratic socialism, we must add
that this planned economy formed a hard core which
was surrounded by an ample fringe of private enterprise
that remained free.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>That the accumulation of private wealth was accepted
by the community as a matter of course is
shown by the rule that a proportion of the rent of <i>uru-lal</i>
land had to be paid in silver and not in produce.
Moreover, the variety of imported articles testifies to
the scope left to barter. It is true that the import and
export trade was again organized at the centre. Merchants
travelled abroad to obtain stones, gold, silver,
copper, lead, wood, and aromatics for the temple. In
exchange they could offer grain, dates, onions, and
similar produce. But their best opportunities were offered
by the produce, not of the rich Mesopotamian
soil, but of the skill of the people. Manufactured goods
sent abroad included, above all (and at all times),
textiles&mdash;woollen clothing, hangings, and carpets&mdash;and
also, to judge by the wide distribution of Sumerian
types of tools, weapons, and jewellery, metal objects
fashioned in the Plain from imported materials. The
merchant in those early days was concerned exclusively
with export and import. He did not conduct
trade among members of his own community; he exchanged
locally finished goods for products of other
cities in the Plain or of foreign countries like Elam. It
is significant that in return for his effort he received an
allotment of land&mdash;certain proof that he was in the
service of the community. Moreover, he had the use of
a team of donkeys belonging to the temple, no doubt
in view of his travels (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>). It seems likely enough
that the merchants found opportunities for private
trade on the side, and it remains uncertain to what extent
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
they supplied directly the imported articles found
in houses. In excavations, for instance, handmills consisting
of flat stones with roundish grinders were found
in every house. Yet the hard volcanic stones used for
them must all have been imported. In the private
tombs of the end of the Protoliterate period lead tumblers
and stone vases are common. At Khafajah copper
vessels, and stands for stone food dishes, or drinking
cups, or lamps, are found in graves of the Second
Early Dynastic period. The somewhat later cemeteries
at Kish and Ur show even greater luxury and refinement.
There were found copper mirrors; copper and
gold toilet sets&mdash;tweezers, a toothpick, and an ear-scoop,
fastened on a ring and carried in a small conical
case; pins of copper or silver with round lapis lazuli
heads; beads and animal pendants of alabaster, carnelian,
and lapis lazuli, and other semi-precious stones.
The silversmith knew how to make filigrain pendants
and girdle clasps, and even fine-linked chains.</p>
<p>Most of these articles were, of course, luxuries. In
matters of dwelling, food, and clothing, the country
was self-supporting. The houses were built of sun-dried
bricks and make an entirely unpretentious impression.
They do not show a regular system of planning.
Rooms were fitted together as the available plot
allowed. Doors were low and arched; one had to stoop
to pass from one room to another. Windows were
small and high up in the walls and fitted with wooden
bars or with screens of baked clay. But the ruins of
mud brick do not give a fair impression of the setting
in which these people lived. We must imagine the
floors covered with smooth, clean rush mats, the walls
and benches with gaily coloured rugs and blankets.</p>
<p>The people wore a shawl-like dress, wound round
the waist, sometimes with one end pulled round the
back and forward over the left shoulder (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>). It
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
is rendered on the monuments in a manner which suggests
sheep or goatskin, but this may be a ceremonial
dress only, for it is certain that textiles were worn and
they are depicted from the middle of the third millennium
onward.</p>
<p>Thus the actual remains found in the excavations
demonstrate that the temple community did not impose
as rigid a form of life on its members as our description
may have suggested; and the texts, in proving
the existence of private property and trade, corroborate
the elasticity of the system. We know, moreover,
that it was able to bear the strain of hard times; for it
has been calculated<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> that the temple received a great
deal more grain from the <i>nigenna</i> land and as rent
than was normally needed. The accumulated reserves
were made available in an emergency&mdash;a better safeguard
of the people&rsquo;s food supply than reliance on individual
providence might have been. It seems also that
the temple supplied rations during the interval between
sowing time and harvest, when stores were
low.<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>The accounts of the temple do not differentiate between
its role as central store of the community and
its religious function; goods withdrawn for sacrifices
are treated exactly like those serving for rations. The
distinction in function was apparently not made. The
temple community was a religious institution regulating
the social life of the community, and the two
aspects which we distinguish were apparently experienced
as one and indivisible.</p>
<p>The temple community seems not, however, to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
been a political institution. The oldest such institutions
of which traces have yet been recognized<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> show the
same equalitarian spirit as the organization of the religious
community. Political authority seems originally
to have rested with the citizens; sovereign power
under the city god lay in an assembly&mdash;presumably
consisting of all free males&mdash;guided by a group of
elders who seem, moreover, to have been in charge of
current affairs. Since the terms for &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; and
&ldquo;elders&rdquo; occur already in the Protoliterate tablets, we
can surmise that these peculiar political institutions existed
as long as the cities themselves.</p>
<p>It is well to recognize the extraordinary character of
this urban form of political organization. It represents
in the highest degree the intensified self-consciousness
and self-assertion which we recognized as distinctive
of the innovations of the Protoliterate period. It is a
man-made institution overriding the natural and primordial
division of society in families and clans. It
asserts that habitat, not kinship, determines one&rsquo;s affinities.
The city, moreover, does not recognize outside
authority. It may be subjected by a neighbour or a
ruler; but its loyalty cannot be won by force, for its
sovereignty rests with the assembly of its citizens.
Thus, the early Mesopotamian cities resembled those
of Greece, of the Hanseatic League, of Renaissance
Italy, in many respects. In all these cases we meet local
autonomy, the assumption that every citizen is concerned
with the common weal, and a small group of
influential men who deal with current affairs and
sometimes impose an oppressive oligarchy upon the
mass of the people.</p>
<p>We do not know whether oligarchic rule ever became
a Mesopotamian institution. Our Protoliterate
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
sources are too scanty to disclose gradations of power
within the existing framework. And in Early Dynastic
times, when the texts became plentiful, the framework
had collapsed and the old institutions were no more
than ghostlike survivals of the past. But it was single
rule rather than oligarchy which had supplanted the
assembly.</p>
<p>The reason for the change is clear; the equalitarian
assembly possessed the disadvantages of freedom to an
uncommon degree. Subjection to the will of the majority,
as expressed in a vote, was unknown. The assembly
continued deliberation under the guidance of
the elders until practical unanimity was reached. This
might be the result of true agreement, or of mass emotion,
or due to a prudent concurrence of the opponents
with a line of action advocated by a powerful group.
In any case, it was not easily attained; and in an emergency
when quick decision and purposeful action was
required, the Mesopotamian city, like the Roman republic,
put itself into the hands of a dictator. In
Sumer he was called <i>lugal</i>, which means &ldquo;great man&rdquo;
and is habitually translated &ldquo;king.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>Kingship was a <i>bala</i>, a &ldquo;reversion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;return to
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
origin.&rdquo; In other words, the kingly office had a limited
tenure; at the end of the emergency authority reverted
to the assembly. But, in practice, the threat of an emergency
was never absent once the cities flourished and
increased in number. Contiguous fields, questions of
drainage and irrigation, the safeguarding of supplies
by procuring safety of transit&mdash;all these might become
matters of dispute between neighbouring cities. We
can follow through five or six generations a futile and
destructive war between Umma and Lagash with a
few fields of arable land as the stakes. Under such conditions
the kingship seems to have become permanent
in certain cities.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the concentrated authority called for by
the dangers to which the community was frequently
exposed was conferred upon leaders who held important
permanent offices. Some of these were exalted
enough to enable their holders, when emergencies
arose, to exercise power similar to that of the <i>lugal</i>.
The <i>sangu</i> or <i>nubanda</i> in the temple of the city god
was the administrative leader of the most important
temple community in the city. For him to become the
political leader of the city was perfectly feasible, but
in such a case the official who had usurped the prerogatives
of a ruler assumed, instead of the secular title
<i>lugal</i>, a title emphasizing his dependence on the city
god and proclaiming, by implication, the god&rsquo;s agreement
with his rule. This title was <i>ensi</i>, best translated
as &ldquo;governor&rdquo; (viz. of the god).</p>
<p>Whether <i>lugal</i> or <i>ensi</i>, the city ruler in Mesopotamia
did not derive his position from any innate superiority
or right of birth. He acted either on behalf of the assembly,
or as steward of the real sovereign, the city
god. In theology, personal rule was sanctioned by a
doctrine of divine election which remained the foundation
of kingship down to the end of the Assyrian empire.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Divine approval could be withdrawn at any time,
and the formation of a dynasty, the succession of the
son to the throne of the father, although known already
in Early Dynastic times, had no basis in the
theory of kingship but was interpreted in each case as
a sign of favour bestowed by the gods. These limiting
conceptions of the monarchy reflect the preponderant
influence of the city in Mesopotamian thought. Monarchy
remained a problematical institution and failed,
therefore, to become an instrument of unity as it did in
Egypt. It carried in some degree the taint of usurpation,
especially in early times.</p>
<p>The task of the <i>ensi</i> in the main was to co-ordinate
the temple communities within the city. To each he
assigned a share in the common tasks on buildings,
canals, and dikes. These <i>corv&eacute;es</i> were then divided
among the guilds and individual members of a community
by its <i>sangu</i> or <i>nubanda</i>. The <i>ensi</i> dealt, furthermore,
with matters of defence and trade, in other
words, with foreign affairs. The professional soldiers
were under his direct and personal command and
formed an important source of his power within the
city. Like every other citizen, he received an allotment
for his sustenance; but his fields were part of the Common
and were cultivated by the people as part of their
communal task. Here, again, was an opportunity for
abuse of power. Moreover, it became customary to acknowledge
the <i>ensi&rsquo;s</i> exalted position by offering him
presents on the festivals of the gods. He also took a fee
for making legal decisions or decreeing a divorce, and
imposed certain taxes. While he administered the main
temple of the city, he appointed members of his family
to head other temple communities.</p>
<p>Although the assembly seems not to have been
superseded entirely, the effective power of the <i>ensi</i>
was preponderant; and what had been the original
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
strength of Sumerian society, its integration with the
temple organization, became its weakness when the
leaders of the temple communities utilized the need
for leadership, which the growth of the cities called
forth, to oppress the people. We know, for instance,
that one <i>ensi</i> sequestered fields assigned to him on the
Common and used them to build up an independent
&ldquo;estate of the palace,&rdquo; modelled on that of the temple.
The tablets from Fara show how varied an assortment
of people had become directly dependent upon the
<i>ensi</i>: scribes, chamberlains, heralds, pages, cupbearers,
butlers, cooks, musicians, and all kinds of craftsmen.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a>
An equalitarian society had been thoroughly transformed,
and the power assumed by the ruler was reflected
in the presumptions and extortions of his officials.
In fact, the Early Dynastic period ends, in
Lagash, in an abortive attempt to move against the
current and restore the theocratic form of its ideal
prototype to Sumerian society. An <i>ensi</i>, called Urukagina,
states that he &ldquo;contracted with the god Ningirsu
(the city god of Lagash) that he would not deliver up
the orphan and the widow to the powerful man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> He
also put a stop to specific abuses: &ldquo;he took the ships
away from the master of the boatmen; he took the
sheep and asses away from the head-herdsman....
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
He took away from the heralds the tribute which the
<i>sangus</i> paid to the palace.&rdquo; These &ldquo;changes,&rdquo; and
many like them, listed in the so-called reform texts,
mean that the prerogatives usurped by the foremen
and officials were abolished and that these rights were
vested once more exclusively in the temple as a vital
organ of the community.</p>
<p>Urukagina also ended abuses introduced by his own
predecessors; he forbade, to use his own words, &ldquo;that
oxen of the god plough the onion plot of the <i>ensi</i>.&rdquo;
He lowered the fees for interments and for prayer
services. He vindicated the right of the lowly man to
his property:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a good donkey has been born to a royal soldier (?),
and his foreman has said to him, &ldquo;I will buy it from thee&rdquo;&mdash;if
he then lets him buy&mdash;he shall say: &ldquo;Weigh out unto
me silver as much as is pleasing to my heart.&rdquo; And if he
does not let him buy, the foreman shall not molest him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, of course, possible to suppose that Urukagina, by
curbing the power of prominent people, was trying,
not only to restore the temple communities to their
original purity, but also to win the support of the
common people for himself. In any case, factors outside
his control interfered with his plans. He was attacked
by the ruler of the neighbouring city of Umma
and destroyed.</p>
<p>The abuses Urukagina tried to abolish were, in
essence, those which vitiate the realization of any
political ideal. Weaknesses peculiar to Mesopotamia,
however, became clear when serious attempts were
made to establish a unified state comprising all the
separate cities. This change was attempted by Sargon
of Akkad and his successors (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> Sargon had
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
been a high official under a king of Kish, and about
2340 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he founded a city of his own, Akkad. He defeated
Lugalzaggesi, the conqueror of Urukagina, and
other city rulers who opposed him, until he was paramount
throughout the country. Similar successes had
been achieved before his time, but they had always
been short-lived. And while Sargon&rsquo;s rise to power
conformed entirely to the older pattern, a piecemeal
subjection of other cities, he struck out a new course in
consolidating his position. This time the state survived
its founder for several generations. The novelty of his
approach may be due to the fact that he represented a
northern element in the Mesopotamian population
which now became dominant for the first time. This is
indicated by the inscriptions: royal inscriptions and
many business documents began to be written in the
Semitic language which is called Akkadian. This
change, in particular, is responsible for the opinion
held by some scholars that the rise of Sargon represents
a foreign conquest;<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> and it is true that the language
points to the middle Euphrates and adjoining
territories as its country of origin. But this region had
been permeated by Mesopotamian culture for centuries,
and people from that quarter cannot be called
foreigners in the ordinary sense of the word. Already
in Protoliterate times Sumerian civilization had moved
northwards along the two rivers, as the Al Ubaid culture
(probably also Sumerian) had done in prehistoric
times. As Roman influence in barbaric Europe can be
traced by means of coins, the influence of Protoliterate
Mesopotamia throughout the ancient Near East can be
traced by the distinctive cylinder seals of the period.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
They are found as far to the north as Troy, as far to
the south as Upper Egypt, as far to the east as middle,
or even north-east Persia.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> At Brak, on the Khabur in
northern Syria, 500 miles north of Erech, has been discovered
a temple built on the plan of those in the
south, containing similar objects and decorated with
cone mosaics.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> Later, in Early Dynastic times, Ishtar
temples at Mari on the Euphrates and at Assur on the
Tigris were equipped with statues of Sumerian style,
representing men in Sumerian dress.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> Thus it is obvious
that there existed along the two great rivers a cultural
continuum within which people could move
without creating a disturbance in the fabric of civilization.
And the change of language to which we have
referred, points to a gradual but continuous drift of
people towards the south, as if the cultural influences
emanating from Sumer attracted those who had come
under its spell. Evidence of this movement is contained
in Early Dynastic inscriptions. The thoroughly Sumerianized
people of Mari, who had adopted the Sumerian
script, inscribed their statues in Akkadian. The
same seems to have happened at Khafajah near Baghdad.
At Kish, a little farther to the south, the population
seems to have been bilingual.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a></p>
<p>These observations in the field of language are valuable
pointers; there may have been other, intangible,
differences between the northern and the southern elements
in the population of Mesopotamia, differences
which would distinguish two strains with distinct cultural
traditions. And although the old view that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
accession of Sargon of Akkad represents a foreign conquest
is untenable, his reign truly marks a new beginning.
In the arts a new spirit finds magnificent expression,
and in statecraft an entirely new attempt is made
to create a political unity which would comprise the
city states but surpass their scope, and which had no
precedent in the past.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> The house of Sargon appears
as a succession of rulers consistently claiming kingship
over the whole land; and it is possible that their political
ideal was not unrelated with the fact that they
were free, as their predecessors were not, from the
traditional viewpoint which grasped political problems
exclusively in terms of the city. For among most
semitic-speaking people kinship provides the supreme
bond. It is possible that the Akkadian-speaking inhabitants
of middle and northern Mesopotamia had
always acknowledged loyalties which went beyond the
city proper. In Sumer there is no sign of the existence
of such loyalties, nor was there a political institution
which over-arched the sovereignty of the separate
cities. But of Sargon a chronicle reports: &ldquo;He settled
his palace folk for thirty-three miles and reigned over
the people of all lands.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> The first part of this entry
suggests that Sargon allotted parts of lands of temple
communities to his own followers, thus overriding the
age-old local basis of land rights. No conqueror could
rely on the loyalty of the defeated cities, and it seems
as if Sargon built up a personal following, perhaps exploiting
kinship ties in the wide sense of tribal loyalty.
Under his grandson Naramsin, governors of cities
styled themselves &ldquo;slave of the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sargon also seems to have made a bid for the loyalty
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
of the common people. This appears from a change in
the formula for oaths.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> The name of the king could
now be invoked alongside the gods. This had a definite
practical significance: if an agreement thus sworn to
was broken, or if perjury was committed, the king was
involved and would make it his business to uphold the
right of the injured party. This was of the utmost importance,
for the judge had originally been merely an
arbitrator, whose main task was the reconciliation or
satisfying of both parties. He had had no power to enforce
his decisions; and if a man without personal
prestige did not have a powerful patron to &ldquo;overshadow
him,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> there was little chance of his finding
satisfaction in court. The new oath formula put the
king in the position of the patron of all who swore by
his name; in practice he constituted a court of appeal
for the whole land, independent of the cities&mdash;a step of
the greatest importance in the development of Mesopotamian
law and society. Another step towards unification
of the country was the introduction of a uniform
calendar. Hitherto each city had had its own, with its
own month names and festivals. Finally, the existence
of a single monarch, who styled himself &ldquo;King of the
Four Quarters of the World,&rdquo; served as a perpetual
remainder of the unity of the state.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>If pressure from the outside world could be relied
upon to bring about national unity, Mesopotamia
would no doubt have become a single state on the
lines laid down by the kings of Akkad. For the country
was at all times exposed to great dangers. Civilized
and prosperous, but lacking natural boundaries, it
tempted mountaineers and steppe dwellers with the
possibilities of easy loot. Raids could be dealt with by
the cities, but the large-scale invasions, which recurred
every few centuries, required a strong central government
to be repelled. The safeguarding of the trade
routes, too, went beyond the competence of individual
cities, and one would expect them to have co-operated
in a national effort. Indeed, we find an epic, &ldquo;The
King of Battle,&rdquo; which describes how Sargon of Akkad,
at the request of Mesopotamian merchants trading in
Anatolia, went there with an army to champion their
cause. The story may well reflect an actual occurrence,
for Sargon&rsquo;s grandson, Naramsin, built a strong castle
at Brak on the Khabur, and the lumber used in its construction
included not only poplar and plane, but also
ash, elm, oak, and pine, which must have been imported.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a>
The Akkadian kings thus undertook a task
which occupied all succeeding rulers of the land. Even
in the first millennium, the annual sweep of the Assyrian
army up into the mountains of Armenia and
down towards the west was a sustained and systematic
attempt to keep the mountaineers in check; for, with
the unlimited possibilities of retreat into their remote
valleys, it was impossible to subject them permanently.
From Sargon of Akkad on, kings knew that it was
necessary to maintain a unified and centralized state;
it was necessary to dominate the borderlands sufficiently
to meet aggression there; in short, imperialism
was the only guarantee of peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>One would expect to find the people rallying to the
new order imposed by the Akkadian kings, especially
since a feeling of national coherence did exist. The
Sumerians had a phrase, &ldquo;the black-headed people,&rdquo;
to designate themselves as an ethnic unit; and the gods
Enlil and Anu, among others, were worshipped
throughout the land. But this feeling had never found
expression in a political form; it remained without
effect, it seems, on the country&rsquo;s history. The particularism
of the cities was never overcome. At each new
accession of a king in Akkad, the land rose in revolt.
Far from rallying against the barbarians, the people
attempted to revert to the local autonomy which had
been the rule before the rise of Sargon. Similar conditions
persisted throughout the country&rsquo;s history. For
example, the discoveries at Tell Asmar (ancient Eshnunna)
illustrate the prevalence of local over national
considerations. The ruler of that city collaborated with
the Amorites who ravaged the country after the fall of
the Third Dynasty of Ur; the barbarians were tolerated,
and perhaps even assisted in their attacks on
neighbouring towns, which were incorporated into the
state of Eshnunna after the Amorites had looted
them.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
<p>Under the Akkadian kings the tragic pattern of
Mesopotamia&rsquo;s history became visible. About 2180 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
their dynasty collapsed under the onslaught of the
Guti from the Zagros Mountains. Combined invasions
of Elamites and Amorites ended the empire of the
Third Dynasty of Ur in 2025 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The invasions of
Hittites and Kassites ended the empire of Hammurabi&rsquo;s
dynasty in 1595 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The invasion of the
Medes destroyed the Assyrian empire (611 <span class="small">B.C.</span>). The
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
attack of Cyrus the Persian ended Neo-Babylonian
rule (539 <span class="small">B.C.</span>).</p>
<p>The absence of safety and stability in the political
field is entirely in keeping with the prevailing mood of
the country. Mesopotamia achieved her triumphs in an
atmosphere of deep disquiet. The spirit pervading her
most important writings is one of disbelief in man&rsquo;s
ability to achieve lasting happiness. Salvation might
be experienced emotionally in the annual festivals of
the gods, but was not a postulate of theology.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">IV. EGYPT, THE KINGDOM OF THE TWO LANDS</span></h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptians said that Menes, who first ruled
at This,<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> brought the whole of the land under his control.
They designated him as the first king of a first
dynasty and thus unequivocally marked the unification
of their land as the beginning of their history. If we
allow for the telescoping of events by which tradition
often credits a single person with the achievements of
two or more generations, we may say that archaeological
discoveries have corroborated this tradition.
The establishment of the single monarchy appears, indeed,
as the political aspect of the birth of Egyptian
civilization.</p>
<p>We possess contemporary monuments on which two
Upper Egyptian kings&mdash;&ldquo;Scorpion&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a> and Narmer&mdash;record
their conquests in the north country. A votive
macehead (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>) shows the earlier of the two&mdash;Scorpion&mdash;at
the opening of a canal. He wears the tall
white crown which in historical times symbolized dominion
over Upper Egypt. Above this main scene appear
emblems of divinities placed on standards which
serve as gallows to <i>rekhyt</i> birds; these birds, in all
probability, designate inhabitants of Lower Egypt.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Scorpion seems to have subjected the whole Nile
valley, for his monuments have been found as far north
as the quarries of Turah, near Cairo.</p>
<p>Narmer, however, extended his power even over the
marshlands of the Delta and appears, therefore, as the
true prototype of the legendary Menes. Among several
monuments of his which have been preserved, a large
votive palette of slate (Figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <a href="#fig28">28</a>) is the most important.
It seems to be a concrete record of the unification
of Egypt or, at least, of an important stage in its
realization. On one side, Narmer, wearing the crown
of Upper Egypt, destroys a chieftain of the northern
marshes. On the other side, the king, now wearing the
crown of Lower Egypt, inspects a number of beheaded
enemies. Thus Narmer is shown as the first
&ldquo;Lord of the Two Lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to read the Narmer palette
as a mere tale of conquest. The &ldquo;unification of the
Two Lands&rdquo; was, to the Egyptians, not only the beginning
of their history, but also the manifestation of a
preordained order which extended far beyond the political
sphere and bound society and nature in an indestructible
harmony. Of this order Pharaoh was the
champion. Throughout historical times the texts proclaimed
this conviction, and pictorial art expressed it
by great compositions in which the towering figure of
the king destroys, single-handed, the misguided
wretches who have sided with chaos in opposing Pharaoh&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
regimen. It is significant that this aspect of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
power should be expressed in art for the first time
in the reign of Narmer.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></p>
<p>To appreciate the novelty of the design of the
Narmer palette, we must investigate its antecedents.
Material and shape proclaim it as a specimen of a
common type of toilet article: throughout predynastic
times slate palettes (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>) had been used for the
grinding of a green powder which, put on the lids,
protected the eyes against glare and infection. On the
Narmer palette, too, a round space is set aside for this
purpose, even though the size of the object seems to
preclude actual use. Now palettes, as well as combs,
knife-handles, and so on, had been embellished with
reliefs during the last phase of the predynastic period.
Among such decorated objects, two treat new subjects.
The first, an ivory knife-handle found at Gebel el Arak
in Upper Egypt (Figs. <a href="#fig23">23</a>, <a href="#fig24">24</a>), shows, on one side, the
pursuit of game, a motif which recurs on other objects
of the same age; on the other side is depicted a battle.
The second, the Hunters&rsquo; palette (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>), shows two
groups of men who have joined forces in an attempt
to destroy lions, perhaps because these infested wasteland
which had to be reclaimed. The two groups are
identified by standards carried in their midst.</p>
<p>The battle scene and the hunting scene are without
parallels in predynastic times. But they are likewise
unconnected with later Egyptian art. Their novelty
consists in the rendering of communal action, their un-Egyptian
character in the manner of that rendering.
Both knife-handle and palette present a faithful record
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
of the actual course of events: groups of men are engaged
in combat or move together towards game. We
must suppose that some of the figures stand for leaders
or chieftains, but there is nothing by which we can
identify them. Each scene shows the melee characteristic
of the occasion. But to the Egyptian of historical
times such a veristic rendering was totally unacceptable.
It hid the true significance of occurrences by
merely rendering their outward appearance. However
large the masses that moved in battle, built temples or
pyramids, went into the deserts to quarry stone or
mine gold, they were moved by the will of their divine
ruler. Art was adequate to its purpose only if it stressed
this fact. It did so by using, throughout two and a half
millennia, variants of Narmer&rsquo;s composition. Note that
on the macehead of Scorpion, the classical Egyptian
viewpoint is not yet rendered in its purity: men are
shown to assist the ruler;<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a> and the strangled <i>rekhyt</i>-birds
swing from the standards of the gods. On some
other fragments which antedate Narmer<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a> the divine
standards are provided with hands to show their active
participation in a ruler&rsquo;s victory. But on the Narmer
palette, as on all monuments of historical times, Pharaoh
acts alone. The standards of the gods have become
adjuncts to his progress (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>), and men are merely
followers; no act of theirs can be significant beside his
own.</p>
<p>If the characteristic Egyptian conception of kingship
first received pictorial expression under Narmer,
it found its first literary embodiment in a famous text
which, from internal evidence, must likewise be assigned
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
to the formative years of Egypt.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> This is the
so-called Memphite Theology. The lasting value of the
theory of kingship which it expounded is shown by the
fact that the only copy now extant was made as late as
the reign of king Shabaka in the eighth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
Moreover, it relates the theory with an act of Menes,
the founding of Memphis. The text concerns us, therefore,
because of the date of its inception; the act which
it presupposes; and the interpretation which it offers.</p>
<p>The significance of the age of our text is evident. In
view of the overriding importance of the institution of
kingship for Egyptian society, the formulation of a
theory of kingship at the very beginning of the monarchy
aptly illustrates the emergence of the &ldquo;form&rdquo; of
Egyptian civilization at that critical time.</p>
<p>Reference to the founding of Memphis is made in
our text by implication: its tenor is to emphasize the
profound significance of the city. Thus the content
corroborates the linguistic evidence for an early date
of the document, since a trustworthy tradition, preserved
by Herodotus, ascribed the founding of Memphis
to Menes. The text expounds the theology of the
new foundation. Of the actual course of events the following
account survived into Greek times: it was believed
that Menes threw up a dike across the western
part of the valley north of the Fayum, thus compelling
a branch of the Nile to rejoin the main stream, and reclaiming
fifty miles of valley. On the newly won land
he then founded a royal castle, a little to the south of
modern Cairo. It was called &ldquo;The White Walls,&rdquo; and
thus characterized as an Upper Egyptian foundation&mdash;for
white was the colour of the mother-goddess
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
Nekhbet, the protectress of Upper Egypt and of the
king&rsquo;s house. But the new settlement was not really a
capital of the united country. The successors of Menes
in the First and Second dynasties did not even reside
there. They seem to have maintained their residence
at This and were buried in neighbouring Abydos,<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a>
within the district whence their ancestors had come.
Memphis was originally&mdash;and remained for fifteen
hundred years almost exclusively (see <a href="#Page_97">pp. 97 f.</a>)&mdash;a
sacred city, the locus where events of unparalleled importance
for the Egyptian commonwealth had taken
place. The Memphite Theology deals precisely with
these events.</p>
<p>We have elsewhere attempted to elucidate the text,
which is too abstruse to be discussed here.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a> It translates
history into mythology and purports to reveal
thereby the transcendent significance of Menes&rsquo;
achievement. Later generations acknowledged the
validity of these early teachings by their deeds: each
new king came to Memphis to celebrate the &ldquo;Union
of the Two Lands&rdquo; and to perform the &ldquo;Circuit of the
White Wall,&rdquo; as Menes was thought to have done when
he had constructed his royal castle.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
<p>The state which Menes created was habitually referred
to as &ldquo;The Two Lands,&rdquo; a designation apt to be
misunderstood; we meet here&mdash;as so often in Egypt&mdash;a
term with cosmological rather than political connotations.
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
We have shown elsewhere<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a> that the dualistic
mould of the &ldquo;Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt&rdquo;
satisfied the Egyptian mode of thought which conceived
totality as an equilibrium of opposites. A meaningful
symmetry was imposed upon the unified land,
but it had no basis in fact, for Scorpion and Narmer
conquered the north piecemeal, as far as we know.
Nor is there any sign of resentment against the north.
On the contrary, northerners were found among the
highest in the land: two queens of the First Dynasty
reveal a Delta origin by their names, and officials of
that dynasty, buried near their royal masters at
Abydos, exemplify the Lower Egyptian physical
type.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
<p>The outside world did not challenge the exalted
view of their state which the Egyptians entertained.
None of their neighbours threatened the safety of
&ldquo;The Two Lands&rdquo;; all of them disposed of natural
resources which seemed predestined to be offered as
tribute to the divine ruler of Egypt. We have seen that
the southern littoral of the Mediterranean was not a
desert in antiquity. Narmer&rsquo;s successors had to consolidate
their northern frontiers even though they prevailed
with ease over the neighbouring populations.
Some had to fight the Libyans in the west. At the
malachite mines in Sinai, Semerkhet recorded his victory
over the local Bedouin on a rock-stela repeating
the main motif of Narmer&rsquo;s palette. Another king of
the First Dynasty had an ivory gaming piece engraved
with the picture of a bound Syrian captive. The roofing
beams of the royal tombs at Abydos consist of coniferous
wood imported from the Lebanon. Jugs of
Syrian and Palestinian manufacture have been found
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
in these tombs and in those of dignitaries buried at
Saqqara: they probably served as containers of olive
oil. Gold, ivory, ostrich feathers, and ebony came
through Nubia from inner Africa.</p>
<p>However, in this phase of Egyptian civilization,
signs of contact with a yet more distant region are also
found. They differ in character from those we have
just mentioned. Libya, Sinai, and Syria supplied the
Nile valley with much-needed raw materials; but
Sumer supplied ideas. Imported Mesopotamian cylinder
seals have been found in Egypt, and the same odd
form of seal was adopted in Egypt. The earliest Egyptian
brick buildings resemble the Protoliterate temples
of Mesopotamia in all significant matters of technique.
Egyptian art&mdash;even in the Narmer palette&mdash;used Mesopotamian
motifs. Even writing seems to have been due
to the stimulus derived from acquaintance with Mesopotamian
writing of the end of the Protoliterate period.</p>
<p>We have dealt with these matters in an <a href="#c7">Appendix</a>.
For although it is certain that contact between the two
great centres of the Near East took place, it did not
affect the social and political sphere with which we
are concerned here. In fact, if we look back over the
evidence presented in this chapter, the autochthonous
character of the Egyptian development is unmistakable.
The basic structure of the society which emerged
was the direct opposite of that which came into being
in Mesopotamia. In Egypt the great change did not
lead to a concentration of social activity in urban
centres. It is true that there were cities in Egypt, but,
with the single exception of the capital, these were no
more than market towns for the countryside. Paradoxically
enough, the capital was less permanent than the
towns in the provinces, for in principle it served for
only a single reign. Each pharaoh took up residence
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
near the site chosen for his tomb, where, during the
best part of his lifetime, the work on the pyramid and
its temple continued, while the government functioned
in the neighbouring city. But after his death the place
was abandoned to the priests and officials who maintained
his cult and managed his mortuary estate, unless
the new king decided to continue in residence
because the adjoining desert offered a suitable site for
his own tomb. Until the middle of the second millennium
<span class="small">B.C.</span> (when Thebes assumed a metropolitan character)
there was no truly permanent capital in Egypt,
a situation which clearly demonstrates the insignificant
role played by the concept of the city in the political
thought of the Egyptians.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a> In Mesopotamia, on the
other hand, even the most powerful rulers of the land
styled themselves rulers of cities and functioned as
such, in Akkad or Ur, in Babylon or in Assur.</p>
<p>The contrast in social structure and the divergent
conceptions of kingship can be seen as correlated. The
city as the ultimate form of political organization is inconceivable
without a ruler who remains potentially
one among many; conversely, absolute power entails
a unified realm. We did, therefore, not lose sight of
our theme when we discussed in this chapter the
origin of the myths and rites of kingship under Menes;
nor is it due to the accident of discovery that we
studied the birth of Egyptian civilization with the aid
of royal monuments. For Pharaoh symbolized the community
in its temporal and transcendent aspects, and,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
for the Egyptians, civilized life gravitated around the
divine king.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the rise of the monarchical society
of Egypt must now be complemented by a concrete
description. The administration of the country<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> functioned
on the strength of delegated royal power. Pharaoh
was the living fount of law, governing by decrees
which were formulated as inspired decisions.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a> In
early times the government assumed a somewhat patriarchal
character. Sons and other close relatives of
Pharaoh acted as his principal advisors and aids. Distant
relatives and descendants of past rulers were
found in minor government posts. At first no single
minister stood between the king and the various
branches of the administration. There was no Grand
Vizier. Under the Fourth Dynasty, however, the vizierate
was introduced as the apex of the bureaucracy;
but it was, at first, occupied by a prince of royal blood.</p>
<p>Even in later times the king reserved certain prerogatives,
such as the imposition of the death penalty and
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
of mutilations; and the vizier had an audience each
morning to report on the state of the land. Nevertheless,
the vizier&rsquo;s power of initiative was very great. He
was Chief Justice, Head of the Archives, and, in fact,
of every government department. His messengers travelled
through the country carrying his orders to the
local administrators and reporting back to him on the
conditions they observed. One of his designations was
&ldquo;to whom is reported all that is and is not.&rdquo; In view of
the overwhelming importance of agriculture for the
state, every transaction involving land had to be registered
at the Vizier&rsquo;s office. After the Sixth Dynasty the
vizier was, probably for practical reasons, &ldquo;Mayor of
the Town,&rdquo; that is, head and military governor of the
royal residence.</p>
<p>The administration which functioned under the
vizier was divided into several departments. First
among these was the Exchequer, headed by the
&ldquo;Treasurer of the god (<i>i.e.</i> king).&rdquo; This was the central
depot for all imposts and duties owed to the state.
In view of the ideal form of the Dual Monarchy it was
called &ldquo;The Two White Houses,&rdquo; but in practice there
was no division. It had branches with storehouses
throughout the country where the dues were collected
and from where the central treasury was supplied. The
administration was highly centralized; and the Treasurer
was responsible, not only for the collection and
disposal of the native produce paid in as taxes, but
also for the royal expeditions which, as we shall see,
brought new materials such as copper, malachite,
wood, or gold, from abroad. Therefore he sometimes
bore the title &ldquo;general&rdquo; or &ldquo;admiral&rdquo; and had troops
and ships at his disposal.</p>
<p>The second important government department was
the Ministry of Agriculture, in which a &ldquo;Chief of the
Fields&rdquo; dealt with purely agricultural matters, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
a &ldquo;Master of (the King&rsquo;s) Largesse&rdquo; was concerned
with everything pertaining to livestock.</p>
<p>These government departments were not rigidly
separated, and an administrative career was likely to
take a man through all of them, as well as through the
local administration. Promising young men, or sons of
those whom the king trusted or favoured, were educated
at court, and then acquired administrative experience
by passing through a succession of posts
which they filled with the assistance of knowledgeable
scribes of the relevant departments. Methen (Fourth
Dynasty) was a Royal Kinsman who acted successively
as Scribe of the Exchequer, apparently also as Physician,
then as District Chief, Judge, Supervisor of all
the flax of the king, to end as nomarch or ruler of a
province. In this last function he administered three
provinces in succession&mdash;which proves that the administration
was independent of local worthies. At the end
of the Old Kingdom the nomarchs had achieved some
sort of permanence by regularly obtaining their offices
for their sons as their successors, and so they developed
into a landed gentry. At first, however, they were royal
officials who were moved from one post to another,
who had no pretence to independence and no local
ties. Their affinities and interests&mdash;as those of all officials&mdash;were
with the court; and Methen remained
until the end &ldquo;Master of the King&rsquo;s Hunt,&rdquo; a purely
courtly function.</p>
<p>Neither the several departments of the government
nor the central and local administrations were clearly
delimited, and their province remained ill-defined until
the end. It has been pointed out, for instance,<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a>
that, under the New Kingdom, tribute from abroad
could be received upon arrival in Egypt by the
&ldquo;Treasurer of the god&rdquo; as head of the Exchequer, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
the &ldquo;Supervisor of the Treasury,&rdquo; his subordinate, by
lower officials of the Exchequer, by the vizier, by high
military commanders, or by the chief priest of Amon.
This fluidity of competence is simply due to the fact
that all authority was delegated royal power and
hence comprehensive in its very nature. There was
similarly a vagueness of demarcation between the central
and the local authorities; and when Seti I (Nineteenth
Dynasty) issued a decree commanding that the
temple of Abydos should receive its shipments of gold
from Nubia without being subject to tolls and other
dues normally levied from ships in transit, he had to
address his decree to twelve different classes of officials,
starting with the vizier and so down to &ldquo;the
mayors and the controllers of camps in Upper and
Lower Egypt ... every inspector belonging to the
king&rsquo;s estate and every person sent on a mission to
Nubia.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> For local officers, no less than those of the
central government, represented Pharaoh. A nomarch
of the Fifth Dynasty, Nesutnefer,<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> is marked by his
titles as &ldquo;Leader of the Land (<i>i.e.</i> province),&rdquo; which
probably meant that he was the head of the provincial
administration in all its branches. He was &ldquo;Chief of
Fortifications,&rdquo; which meant that he was head of the
police as well as responsible for the guarding of the
frontiers of his province against desert tribes. He was
&ldquo;Ruler of the King&rsquo;s People,&rdquo; namely, of the serfs and
tenants, bailiffs and stewards, craftsmen, scribes, fishermen,
and so on, who were employed on the royal domains
within his province, whether they were free or
bond. Finally, he was called &ldquo;Chief of Commands,&rdquo;
which meant that orders from the king or the vizier
went to him and that he was responsible for their being
carried out in his province.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In the nomarchs we find an element most dangerous
to the unity of the state. Under the Old Kingdom there
was, at first, no question of any power opposing the
king. Nesutnefer, whose office we have just described,
was twice transferred to another province. But the
kings rewarded their faithful servants with gifts of
land; and, at the same time, officials pressed for hereditary
appointments. Officially this claim was never admitted,
but in practice there was an advantage in letting
a son succeed his father, since the loyalty of the
incumbent of an office was then ensured and his successor
was certain to receive most careful professional
training. However, the two tendencies together
changed the relation between the great officials and
the king in the course of time. Hereditary offices and
property turned the officials into landed proprietors
who were no longer entirely dependent upon their
function at court,<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a> although, as long as the central
power remained strong, Pharaoh could cancel all
rights to land or to office at any time. Nevertheless,
when the central administration collapsed completely
at the end of the Sixth Dynasty, the hereditary landowners
were in a position to assume responsibility for
the maintenance of rule and order in their districts.
The manors of their estates were turned into miniature
courts. This situation flouted every native theory and
practice of government, and it did not outlast the
period of confusion. The kings of the Twelfth Dynasty
restored centralized government.</p>
<p>It is possible to gain a clear idea of the mentality of
the Egyptian official, since many texts define the norms
of his behaviour. The ideal official was &ldquo;the silent
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
man,&rdquo; who is respectful of established authority and
just, since <i>maat</i> (which means truth, justice, rightness)
is part of that world order of which his royal master is
the champion. The &ldquo;silent man&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a> is, therefore, not
the meek sufferer, but the wise, self-possessed, well-adapted
man, modest and self-effacing up to a point,
but deliberate and firm in the awareness that he is
thoroughly in harmony with the world in which he
lives.</p>
<p>We cannot draw a corresponding picture of the
common people of Egypt. Since they were illiterate,
they are known to us only in descriptions of peasant
life from the schools of scribes; and these are tendentious,
singing the advantages of a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; job as an encouragement
to the pupils involved in the arduous task
of mastering the script. Notwithstanding the smug
complacency of these texts and the evident satisfaction
which the writers found in parodying every employment
other than their own, the section dealing with
the peasantry is worth quoting since it pictures well
enough the farmer&rsquo;s lot under inefficient or corrupt administrators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember you not the condition of the cultivator faced
with the registering of the harvest tax, when the snake has
carried off half the corn and the hippopotamus has devoured
the rest? The mice abound in the fields. The locusts
descend. The cattle devour. The sparrows bring disaster
upon the cultivator. The remainder that is on the threshing
floor is at an end, it falls to the thieves. The value of the
hired cattle (?) is lost. The yoke of oxen has died while
threshing and ploughing.</p>
<p>And now the scribe lands on the river bank and is about
to register the harvest tax. The janitors carry staves and the
Nubians (policemen) rods of palm, and they say, &ldquo;Hand
over the corn,&rdquo; though there is none. The cultivator is
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
beaten all over, he is bound and thrown into the well,
soused, and dipped head downwards. His wife has been
bound in his presence, his children are in fetters. His neighbours
abandon him and are fled.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If such brutality had been the rule, it is clear that
Egyptian society could not have survived. Agriculturalists
are inevitably the prey of occasional calamities
because they are dependent on weather and water.
But if disasters follow one another frequently without
relief, or if oppression by those in power exceeds a
certain limit, there is no inducement for the peasant to
continue his labours at all. He takes to flight or to revolt.
We have seen why the texts used in the scribal
schools emphasized the shadow-side of the peasant&rsquo;s
lot. Moreover, we should remember that the humdrum
normal life of the rural population offered no interest
to the <i>literati</i>. The elementary satisfactions of a life
wedded to nature, its crafty game of hiding assets
from the bureaucrats, its tough endurance of injustice,
the latent power of its indispensability&mdash;all these did
not supply the scribal schools with material for the
florid compositions which were their pride.</p>
<p>It was otherwise with the sculptors and painters.
These men, charged with depicting on the walls of the
great tombs the various rural activities from which
the sustenance of the owner, in the next world, as in
this, derived,<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> rendered these with the liveliest interest.
Their work (Figs. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <a href="#fig30">30</a>) presents to us a gay,
light-hearted people, resembling in many respects the
modern fellahin who similarly live on the verge of poverty
under hardship and oppression. In the tombs we
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
see fishermen and herdsmen at their tasks, joking with
one another (the words are sometimes rendered over
their images). Harvesters move in a row, rhythmically
swinging their sickles to the tune of a song which is
accompanied by a man with a long reed pipe (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a> Women bring food to their menfolk; two little
girls squabble, while a third draws a thorn from the
foot of her friend; a shepherd dozes under a tree, his
dog asleep beside him (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>);<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a> another herdsman
refreshes himself from a goatskin bottle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>None of these people was free; not a single Egyptian
was, in our sense of the word, free. No individual
could call in question a hierarchy of authority which
culminated in a living god. But it must not be forgotten
that the reverse of freedom, isolation of the
individual with or without &ldquo;inalienable rights,&rdquo; was
likewise lacking in Egypt. And servitude loses much
of its sting if authority rests with those to whom faith
has attributed the power of safeguarding the existence
of society. Moreover, if it was true that all were at the
disposal of the divine ruler and his officials, it was also
true that even the lowliest might appeal to him<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> and
claim what was &ldquo;right&rdquo;&mdash;<i>maat</i> (justice, right, and
truth)&mdash;by which the ruler and the other gods were
said to live and which informed, or was supposed to
inform, his functionaries.</p>
<p>There were no castes, and men of simple origin
might rise to the highest posts. The life-story of one
Uni under three successive kings of the Sixth Dynasty
shows that even lower officials, without influential relations,
could rise to the highest offices once their
ability and integrity had been recognized. The talented
and industrious were not frustrated by a rigid class
distinction or by a colour bar. A Nubian, frankly calling
himself Panehsi, &ldquo;the Nubian,&rdquo; or &ldquo;negro,&rdquo; might
be found in the highest places. The educated men
were assigned by Pharaoh to whatever offices he
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
thought fit. The common people were mostly tied to
the land which they tilled for their own living and for
the maintenance of the state. We do not know whether
or not they were serfs. We do know that they had to
turn in a considerable proportion of their produce as
taxes and that they were liable to <i>corv&eacute;e</i>. A proportion
of the young men of all villages and estates was levied
for the army, which was really a militia, but functioned
much more frequently as a labour corps, available
for all kinds of public works. It was this &ldquo;army&rdquo;
which was sent on quarrying and mining expeditions,
which dug the canals and built the temples and the
royal tombs. If additional labour was needed to undertake
special tasks or to expedite those in hand, the
population at large could be drafted. For instance, the
number of men required for the building of pyramids
ran into many thousands, and it is likely that the stone-cutters
and their crews of unskilled helpers worked
continuously in the quarries, the masons and their
navvies on the site, but that during the inundation
special levies were drafted to transport the stone from
Tura, on the east bank, to Gizeh or Saqqara on the
west bank of the Nile. For this purpose it was convenient
that in summer, when the arable land was
flooded, all agricultural labour came to a standstill,
and the water covering the fields facilitated transport
to the very foot of the desert plateau.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a></p>
<p>We have some evidence of the life which these
labourers lived. Three places are known where workmen
were housed. Near the pyramid of Chephren at
Gizeh there are, around a court, extensive barracks
consisting of ninety-one galleries, each 88 feet long,
9&frac12; feet wide, and 7 feet high. Petrie estimated that
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
these could house 4000 men. Near the pyramid of
Senusert II at Lahun there is a walled town covering
an area 900 by 1200 feet. And at Tell el Amarna, near
the northern group of rock tombs, is a walled village
measuring only 210 by 210 feet (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a> Its layout
is dreary, with identical houses built back to back
along straight streets. Each house consists of a court
serving for kitchen and workshop, a central room as
living-room, and two little bedrooms at the back. The
enclosure wall has but one gate, opening on a square
where the men no doubt mustered before being
marched off to work. At one end of the square there is
a larger house for the foreman or commandant. Described
in this way the settlement makes the impression
of a penal colony. But when one visits the site or
reads the excavation report with some care, that impression
changes. One is struck by the variations
which one observes in going from house to house. Although
the plans are identical, the tenants had made
many changes to suit their individual needs and predilections.
The internal arrangements are hardly ever
the same. The objects found in the houses also show
considerable variety and do not suggest penury or
gloom. In one room was discovered a gay, painted
frieze of dancing figures of the god Bes, the popular
genius of music and love. One gets a distinct impression
at the site that lack of freedom neither interfered
with the home life of these workers nor destroyed their
gaiety.</p>
<p>Abuses naturally existed. Royal decrees granting
freedom from <i>corv&eacute;e</i>, or levy, to the personnel of certain
shrines explicitly protected these men against removal
to other parts of the country, and show incidentally
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
that common folk were exposed to this hazard.
The small man was dependent on the protection of a
man of influence whose client he might become if he
was not already his serf. At this distance of time we
cannot distinguish grades of servitude. It has been
suggested that the best land of the large estates was
worked with serfs while the less productive fields were
let out to peasants who paid a fixed rent in produce;
but the categories are not clearly distinguishable.
Slaves, however, as distinct from serfs, did not play an
important part in the economy of Egypt. It is doubtful
whether they were kept in any numbers at all before
the New Kingdom.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a> At that time the Syrian campaigns
resulted in large numbers of captives who were
used on royal and temple domains and in stone quarries.
In earlier times captive Nubians may have been
employed occasionally, but such isolated slaves served
in families or at court as domestics, entertainers, dancers,
or musicians and lived (one suspects) very much
like the other servants. It has been pointed out<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a> that
the successful growing of grain requires a personal interest
on the part of the cultivator, which slave labour
lacks.</p>
<p>The craftsmen, too, were usually serving some great
lord. Large numbers were employed by the king. We
know, in fact, that the country was drained of talent
for the benefit of the royal residence. The graves at
Qau el Kebir&mdash;a cemetery in Middle Egypt used
throughout the third millennium&mdash;show the scantiest
equipment, and that of the poorest quality of craftsmanship,
during the flourishing period of the Old
Kingdom when the pyramids were being built. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the central government had collapsed in the First Intermediate
period, both the quality and the intrinsic
value of the grave goods at Qau increased greatly.
When craftsmen worked for the court, it is almost certain
that they, too, were not free agents selling their
wares or their services where they pleased. But we
must, once more, guard against exaggerating their lot;
they were not slaves. We happen, for instance, to know
something of the extensive linen factories of Pharaoh.
Under the Sixth Dynasty a royal weaving establishment
in the north was under the management of one
Seneb, a dwarf who, having worked himself up from
the ranks, married a woman of the class of &ldquo;Royal
Kinsman&rdquo; and could afford to build himself a fine
tomb at Gizeh, from which we get our information.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a>
One of the scenes in this tomb depicts the giving of
rewards to Seneb&rsquo;s subordinates;<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> they receive headbands
and necklaces, and this is significant, for these
ornaments resemble in form the &ldquo;gold&rdquo; with which
Pharaoh honoured officials of special merit. Let us assume
that the jewellery with which the weavers were
rewarded was less costly and consisted of bronze and
fayence. It is nevertheless clear that the award was by
no means a payment but a kind of gift which it was an
honour to receive. Now it is noteworthy that the recipients
depicted in Seneb&rsquo;s tomb are not all overseers
and foremen, but also men and women who are merely
mentioned by name, without title, and who therefore
must be assumed to be simple weavers.</p>
<p>Craftsmen also worked for officials and on the large
estates which came into being towards the end of the
Old Kingdom. Such estates, like the royal domains,
and the temple estates of later times, were self-sufficient
economic units. Each had its own wharves, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
instance,<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a> where Nile boats were built and repaired.
These served not only as ferries, but for every trip of
any length which the owner had to undertake and for
the shipment of grain, cattle, and other dues to the
magazines of the Exchequer. They were used, furthermore,
for shipments of supplies to the funerary establishments
of past members of the family who might be
buried near Memphis in a royal cemetery. When the
weakening of the central power, to which we have referred,
and the concurrent rise of a landed gentry,
made it more and more customary for high officials to
be buried in rock-cut tombs near their estates in the
provinces, the equipment of these tombs was supplied
by masons, cabinet-makers, jewellers, and so on, employed
on the estate. There were, moreover, hunters,
who not only killed game, but caught it to be fattened
for the table; several kinds of antelopes, cranes, and
even hyenas were treated in this way. Fishermen and
fowlers were also employed, for wild geese and duck,
fattened in the barnyard, were consumed in large
numbers. Fish was dried and kept, but it was probably
largely used as rations for labourers.</p>
<p>As regards the cultivators, whether they worked for
a private estate, for a temple, or on a royal domain,
they had to pay imposts of many kinds, and the hamlets
and villages were collectively responsible in the
person of their head man; this worthy had to produce
the stipulated amounts on the day of reckoning or he
risked a beating. The craftsmen, too, were organized
in groups of five or ten men under a foreman who received
their rations of food, clothing, and raw materials
and was responsible for their work. Similar
groups of men, working in shifts of one month, functioned
as &ldquo;hour priests&rdquo; in the temples and funerary
chapels. When they took over, their foremen received
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
the inventory and were responsible for its proper
maintenance.</p>
<p>The material basis of the Egyptian commonwealth
was agriculture, regulated by the unaltering rhythm
of the inundation. The names of the three seasons (of
four months each) which the Egyptians distinguished
were &ldquo;Inundation&rdquo; (middle of July to middle November),
&ldquo;Coming Forth&rdquo; (of the seeds, or possibly
of the land from the inundation, from middle November
to middle March), and &ldquo;Drought.&rdquo; The conditions
prevailing in prehistoric times, described in the second
chapter, were not materially altered during the Old
Kingdom. Land had to be reclaimed from the marshes.
We have seen that the first king, Menes, undertook
such work on a considerable scale. But the more the
valley was drained, the more the need arose to distribute
the inundation water so that it reached all the
fields. From the beginning of the First Dynasty annual
records of the height of the Nile were kept; their purpose
can only have been to provide a basis for an estimate
of its extent and thereby of the probable yield of
the harvest. The digging of canals and the building of
dikes was normally done by the central government,
but there are some indications that the king encouraged
the nomarchs to reclaim land by granting them
the new fields which they then were allowed to settle
with people from their estates. In the First Intermediate
period when each nomarch had to take care of his
area as best he could, one of them records:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stocked villages in this nome that were enfeebled with
cattle and men of other nomes, and those who had been
serfs elsewhere I made rank as notables.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The annual inundation with its fertilizing deposit of
silt made manuring and rotation of crops unnecessary.
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
The tax records distinguish between low land, which
was regularly inundated, and high land, which came
under water only when the flood was high. This land
was used for grazing or truck gardening. The bulk of
the arable land was left soft by the retreating inundation
and could be worked with primitive wooden hoes
and ploughs. Animals, mostly sheep, were used to
tread in the seed, and this had to be done speedily
after the land had emerged but before it became hard
and dry. Six-rowed barley and emmer wheat were the
main crops. Lettuce, onions, beans, and lentils were, in
antiquity as now, important secondary products. Ricinus
plants were grown for oil, and flax for linen.</p>
<p>When the grain had grown to a certain height, surveyors
measured it to assess it for taxation on an
estimated yield (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>). It was harvested with
sickles, threshed on a circular threshing floor by asses
(and later by cattle) who trod out the kernels. As a
rule, women did the winnowing by throwing the grain
up in a winnowing basket. After that it was stored in
barns or in beehive-shaped silos, and the portion due
to the king or to the estate-owner was handed over.
Large estates, including the royal domains and the
temples, had reserves to supplement bad harvests.
Seed-corn was lent to the tenants, and teams of oxen
and asses for ploughing or carrying were lent or let
out, too. There are records of great landowners relieving
tenants who could not meet their obligations in
difficult years.</p>
<p>But not only the grain harvest was taxed. There was
a tax on canals and ponds, on trees and wells. The
produce of the home industries and of the spare-time
occupations of the people were taxed: they had to turn
over some of their textiles, leatherwork, honey, oil,
wine, vegetables, some of the catch of the fowler and
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
fisherman, some of the increase of the shepherd&rsquo;s
flock. Genesis xlvii. 24 states that one-fifth of all produce
was owed to the government; this may or may not
be correct; it is not improbable. Certain people were
liable to pay fixed quantities of produce, irrespective
of yield.</p>
<p>Again, it is necessary to correct our first reaction to
a description of these conditions. In Egypt personal
enterprise was made subsidiary to the performance of
public duties; and it would seem that under normal
conditions sufficient scope for private initiative, in
production and in barter, remained. The contents of
graves which are best, perhaps, called lower middle
class (since of the poorest people no trace survives)
show as much. It is likewise revealing that during
Egypt&rsquo;s long history no attempts to overthrow the existing
order were made. This shows that the Egyptian
experiment of organizing a rural community was, on
the whole, successful. The obligation to hand over part
of every kind of produce may seem pettifogging to us.
But money was unknown; the state could function only
if it disposed of all kinds of articles to supply those
who were in its service. If officials abused their power
and oppressed the people, the peasants had an effective
weapon at their disposal: they fled. This was a
catastrophe for their owner since he remained liable
for the normal dues on his land, which now lay deserted.
The case is concisely put in a letter written by
a steward to his master who was responsible for the
management of a certain royal domain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another communication for my Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure, to
the effect that two of the field labourers of the <i>mine</i> land
of Pharaoh which is under my Lord&rsquo;s authority, have fled
before the face of the stable-master Neferhotep, he having
beaten them. And now, look, the fields of the <i>mine</i> land
of Pharaoh which are under my Lord&rsquo;s authority are
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
abandoned and there is no one to till them. This letter is
for my Lord&rsquo;s information.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A somewhat patriarchal relationship between master
and men persists in many rural districts of old countries
even to-day. A certain amount of arbitrariness,
even of despotism, is taken for granted in the great; it
is their privilege, but only if it is counterbalanced by
a sense of responsibility for the land and for those who
till it.</p>
<p>We may, therefore, accept as inherently probable
such statements as the following, made by an Upper
Egyptian nomarch who had taken matters in his own
hands in the First Intermediate period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was one who computed (carefully) the consumption
of Lower Egyptian grain.... I made a canal for this town
when Upper Egypt was in a bad way, and one did not see
any water.... I made high fields into marsh, I made the
Nile inundate wasteland.... Whoever needed water got
Nile water as he desired.... I was great in Lower Egyptian
grain (barley) when the country was in tribulation.
I was the one who fed the town with measure and bushel.
I made the small man and his wife carry away Lower
Egyptian grain and (likewise) the widow and her son. I
had all imposts reduced which I found registered (as arrears)
from the time of my father.<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another nomarch, at Crocodilopolis in Upper Egypt,
south of Thebes, reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fed the &ldquo;island in the river&rdquo; (Crocodilopolis) during
years of drought when 400 men were (in penury) there. I
did not take away a man&rsquo;s daughter nor his field. I acquired
ten flocks of goats with people to take care of them,
two herds of cattle and one of asses. I bred small livestock.
I obtained thirty boats of one kind and thirty of another
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
and brought Upper Egyptian grain to Hermonthis and
Asphynis after Crocodilopolis was taken care of. The nome
of Thebes came upstream (<i>i.e.</i> to obtain grain from me),
but Crocodilopolis never sent downstream nor upstream
(for grain) to another nome.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last inscription makes much of livestock, and
stock-breeding was next in importance to agriculture.
We have seen that a special official, &ldquo;The Master of
the King&rsquo;s Largesse,&rdquo; was in charge of its supervision.
In antiquity, in contrast with now, plenty of marshland
was available for grazing in the valley, and the
large herds were also sent to the Delta in spring to
graze. One official of the Sixth Dynasty lists 1000 head
of cattle, 760 asses, 2200 goats, and nearly 1000 sheep
as his own.</p>
<p>Trade played a subordinate part in the internal
economy of the country. There was, naturally, a great
deal of barter between individuals. There were
markets where food, especially garden produce, or
birds netted in the fields, or fish, were exchanged for
tools or sandals or walking-sticks, necklaces, textiles
or oils&mdash;luxuries or articles which, although issued by
the estate office, might not, in quantity or quality, suit
everyone. Barter in the market-place allowed a man
to adjust his share in various goods to his own particular
taste or to dispose of catches or produce obtained
on the side. These markets are sometimes depicted in
the tombs, and we know that already, in the Old
Kingdom, pieces of metal served as standards of value.
An important object was said to be worth so and so
many rings. In the New Kingdom this system was
simplified, and the value of an object was said to be so
much weight (deben) of gold, silver, or copper. In
the New Kingdom, too, the closer contact with Syria
made more imported articles available for the market
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
trade. A tomb-painting shows a Phoenician ship just
made fast at the quay of Thebes. Some of the crew
have gone ashore and approach booths where sandals,
linen, fruits, and vegetables can be exchanged for a
jug of Syrian oil or wine. This type of trade remained,
however, purely marginal to the economy of Egypt.
Neither the home-grown staple products nor the main
imports were distributed through the markets. We do
not meet the word &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; until the second millennium
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, when it designates the official of a temple
privileged to trade abroad.</p>
<p>Raw materials which Egypt lacked were procured
through royal expeditions, organized by the Exchequer
(which included among its personnel interpreters to
assist the commanders in various foreign countries).<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a>
These expeditions were of two types. In Nubia, the
eastern and western desert, and in Sinai, the nomad
tribes and poor peasants could not oppose the Egyptians
in any way at all. The army came and took what
it needed. On quarrying and mining expeditions the
military component of the expedition was no more
than an armed escort, while the bulk of the &ldquo;army&rdquo;
(as it was called) consisted of navvies to assist a core
of trained stone-cutters or miners.</p>
<p>Another type of expedition was required to obtain
wood from the Lebanon and frankincense and myrrh
from Punt, the Somali coast. These lands were outside
the sphere of Egyptian military influence, and the
native rulers could ask for a price. This was offered in
the form of royal presents to favourite vassals, and
their products were listed as tribute. In reality there
was an exchange; some splendid and extremely costly
Egyptian jewellery, inscribed with the names of Pharaohs
of the Twelfth Dynasty, has been found in tombs
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
of the local princes of Byblos at the foot of the Lebanon.
Coniferous roofing beams in the tombs of the
First Egyptian Dynasty and a record of a sea expedition
of Snefru of the Fourth Dynasty prove the great
age of this lumber trade with the Levant. And from a
late period we have the following list of objects which
an Egyptian envoy&mdash;Wenamon&mdash;offered in exchange
for wood from the Lebanon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five gold and five silver vessels; ten garments of royal
linen; ten pieces of other linen; five hundred pieces of fine
paper; five hundred cattle skins; five hundred ropes; twenty
bags of lentils; thirty baskets of fish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Phoenician export included, besides wood, oil,
wine, resin, and ivory.</p>
<p>It has been said that Pharaoh was the only wholesale
merchant in Egypt and that foreign trade was a
royal monopoly. But the implication of profit-making
and exploitation is inappropriate. It was merely due to
the complete consistency with which the Egyptians
had organized their community as a centralized monarchy
that they supplied themselves with the foreign
materials of which they stood in need by means of
royal expeditions. It is curious evidence of the practical
effectiveness of Pharaonic rule that the absolute
monarchy of Egypt did supply essential commodities,
whether imported or produced at home, to the people
as a whole in sufficient quantities; the distribution took
place &ldquo;from above,&rdquo; the king making gifts and allotments
to his officials who in turn rewarded their retainers
and so down the social scale. And in the First
Intermediate period, when royal power suffered an
eclipse, the texts contain a complaint that there is no
wood available for the making of coffins.</p>
<p>Whatever aspect of Egyptian society we have scrutinized,
we have found Pharaoh at the centre. Yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
nothing would be more misleading than to picture the
Egyptians in abject submission to their absolute ruler.
Their state can be described as &ldquo;a self-directed organism
held together by a common regard for customary
rights and obligations.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> Their polity was not imposed
but evolved from immemorial predilections, and was
adhered to, without protest, for almost three thousand
years. Similar predilections have, in fact, maintained
the institution of divine kingship among Africans related
to the ancient Egyptians down to our own days.
It was good, not evil; it gave a sense of security which
the Asiatic contemporaries of the ancient Egyptians
totally lacked. If a god had consented to guide the
nation, society held a pledge that the unaccountable
forces of nature would be well disposed and bring
prosperity and peace. Nor does the Egyptian view lack
ethical content. Truth, justice, were &ldquo;that by which
the gods live,&rdquo; an essential element in the established
order. Hence Pharaoh&rsquo;s rule was not tyranny, nor his
service slavery.</p>

<p>The problem to which we turn now has been discussed
intermittently for the last fifty years, but in the earlier
discussions preconceived ideas played a considerable
part. For while it is admitted that intercourse stimulates
individuals, it is often believed that granting foreign
influence to have affected a people is derogatory.
The essential difference between mechanical copying
and creative borrowing, between a slavish dependence
on foreign examples and a free selection of congenial
material, is entirely overlooked. Another circumstance,
too, has militated against an unbiased weighing of the
evidence. When our knowledge of the ancient Near
East was fragmentary, it was habitual to explain
changes in terms of conquest and immigration from
some hypothetical, as yet unknown, region; but the
extensive explorations which took place between the
two world wars have discredited this type of explanation,
and the supposed homelands of the newcomers
proved, in cultural matters, to have been peripheral
dependencies of the two great centres in Egypt and
Mesopotamia. These, on the other hand, were seen to
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
have been unusually resistant to foreign influence and
capable of imposing conformity upon all comers.<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a></p>
<p>Our increased knowledge has thus induced an unwillingness
to appeal to foreign influence or migrations
as explanations of cultural changes. Now, however, the
opposite viewpoint receives exaggerated emphasis,
and we find students proudly proclaiming their ignorance
of anthropology and emphasizing, without a
critical examination of all the facts, the autonomy and
self-containedness of the great cultural centres of the
Near East.</p>
<p>Evidence obtained in the decade before the Second
World War allows us, however, to solve the problem,
at least as far as it concerns the formative phase of
Egyptian civilization. For the discovery in Mesopotamia
of remains of the Protoliterate period revealed
the source from which curious and passing features of
Egyptian culture in late predynastic and protodynastic
times were obviously derived.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence of this contact between
Mesopotamia and Egypt is supplied by three cylinder
seals shown by their very material and by their designs
to have been made in Mesopotamia during the
second half of the Protoliterate period (Figs. <a href="#fig33">33</a>, <a href="#fig34">34</a>),
but found in Egypt. One was excavated at Naqada
(<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>), in a Gerzean grave; and the same origin is
probable for the other two.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a> These importations were
not without consequence: from the beginning of the
First Dynasty the cylinder seal was adopted in Egypt
and made at once in considerable quantities. Since it is
an odd form for a seal, used only in countries in contact
with Mesopotamia, and since one of the Mesopotamian
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
cylinders was found in Egypt in a context
just ante-dating the earliest native seals, it would be
perverse to deny that the Egyptians followed the
Mesopotamian example. But it is quite characteristic
for them that they exploited the new suggestion with
the greatest freedom. They even used engraved cylinders
for a purpose for which there is no Mesopotamian
prototype: some of these objects, found in the
graves of the First Dynasty, are not seals at all but
funerary amulets showing the dead man at the table
(Figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <a href="#fig38">38</a>, <a href="#fig39">39</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> In addition, the Egyptians used
cylinders as seals, but they very rarely covered them
with pictorial designs. They engraved upon them the
names and titles of officials written in hieroglyphs
(Figs. <a href="#fig35">35</a>, <a href="#fig36">36</a>). In Mesopotamia the earliest cylinders
(Figs. <a href="#fig14">14</a>-16, <a href="#fig42">42</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>) bear designs, not inscriptions; inscribed
seals are unknown before the second Early
Dynastic period, and then even the inscribed examples
always bear a design as their distinctive feature. Moreover,
the early Egyptian seals are usually made of
wood, a material not used in Mesopotamia, as far as
we know. Since, on the other hand, the cylinder was
better adapted to the sealing of merchandise and clay
tablets than to that of documents on papyrus, it was
replaced in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom by the
stamp seal in the shape of a scarab. The Egyptians,
therefore, in no way copied slavishly the Mesopotamian
invention, but adapted it to their own needs
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
until such a time as they had discovered a more suitable
form of seal.</p>
<p>In the field of art a somewhat similar development
can be observed.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a> We can distinguish two groups of
phenomena: motifs are taken over from Mesopotamian
monuments of the Protoliterate period, or Egyptian
motifs are composed in a manner which is, to judge by
later usage, un-Egyptian and can be understood as a
passing influence of Mesopotamian style. The most
striking example of the copying of an alien, Mesopotamian,
motif, is the group of the man dominating
two lions on the Gebel el Arak knife-handle (<a href="#fig23">Fig. 23</a>).
Such groups are common at all times in Mesopotamia
but exceedingly rare in Egypt. And in the present case
the derivation cannot be doubted: the hero between
the lions copies in every detail of his appearance&mdash;his
garment, his beard, his hair, wound round his head
and bound up in a chignon at the back&mdash;the often recurring
figure of the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; or king depicted on a
granite stela from Erech and on numerous seals (Figs.
<a href="#fig15">15</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>). Even the style of the figure, the way in which
the muscles in the legs are rendered, for instance, is
entirely un-Egyptian, as a comparison with the figures
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
on the other face of the knife-handle (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>) shows.</p>
<p>Other motifs on palettes and knife-handles likewise
have Mesopotamian prototypes. The serpent-necked
lions or panthers on the Narmer palette (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>)
recur, identically intertwined, on seals of the early and
late Protoliterate period (<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>). Winged griffins
(<a href="#fig40">Fig. 40</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a> and intertwined snakes (<a href="#fig40">Fig. 41</a>)<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> are also
at home in Mesopotamia from the Protoliterate period
onwards and put in a passing appearance in Egypt.</p>
<p>Antithetical groups<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> and the carnivore attacking an
impassive prey (Figs. <a href="#fig23">23</a>, <a href="#fig40">40</a>), are examples of Egyptian
designs composed in an un-Egyptian manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a> We
may even formulate the way in which they are un-Egyptian:
they share with the group of the hero
dominating two lions, the intertwined snakes and lions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
and the serpent-necked panthers a pronouncedly unrealistic
character. Animal forms are, in all these instances,
used to produce a decorative design; they are
subjected to a purely aesthetic purpose. And though
the Egyptians eventually used plant motifs in such a
fashion, they never again so employed animal or
human figures. In Mesopotamia, on the other hand,
imagination and design usually prevailed over probability
or nature.<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a> Hence we see, once again, that the
Egyptians experimented with Mesopotamian inventions
during the formative phase of their civilization
but soon rejected what was uncongenial.</p>
<p>There remain two fields in which Mesopotamian examples
have produced results more important than
those we have discussed so far. They are architecture
and writing. With the First Dynasty, monumental
brick architecture makes its appearance in a form,
both as regards material and plan, which recalls the
Protoliterate temples of Mesopotamia.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> It is a moot
point whether bricks were made in Egypt in prehistoric
times. In Persia, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor
(Mersin) they were used on a great scale from the Al
Ubaid period onwards, and were known even earlier.
In Egypt a few bricks have been found in prehistoric
context, but not actually in walls, and whether they
were used for buildings may well be doubted, since in
Nubia, where prehistoric culture continued to flourish
even after the accession of Menes, bricks were used
only at a later date. Moreover, a design on the Hunters&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
Palette (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>), and hieroglyphs representing
traditional palaces and shrines, indicate that predynastic
public buildings were made of wood and matting,
or perhaps of wattle and daub. It is likely that
the palaces and other important buildings of the First
Dynasty were still made of those materials.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> But in
this dynasty highly sophisticated brick architecture is
suddenly used in the construction of graves.</p>
<p>In Egypt secular buildings were at all times less
permanent than tombs and temples. When, from the
Third Dynasty onwards, these were built of stone,
houses and palaces were still built of brick. And this
distinction holds good for all subsequent periods. Under
the First Dynasty, when brick architecture came
into its own, this new and more permanent architecture
was used, at first, for the royal tombs which were
decorated with buttresses and recesses on all four sides
(Figs. <a href="#fig46">46</a>, <a href="#fig47">47</a>, <a href="#fig50">50</a>). This ornamentation was achieved,
in some cases (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>),<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> by the use of two kinds of
bricks&mdash;large ones for the core of the building and
smaller ones for the recessing. These small bricks are
of a size and shape peculiar, in Mesopotamia, to the
latter half of the Protoliterate period and were used
in an identical fashion, three rows of stretchers alternating
as a rule with one row of headers.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> The recesses
and buttresses duplicate exactly the recessing of
Protoliterate temples. Other technical details&mdash;the
manner in which a plinth or platform is constructed
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
(<a href="#fig47">Fig. 47</a>),<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> the use of short timbers inserted horizontally
as the strengthening in the niches (Figs. <a href="#fig49">49</a>,
<a href="#fig50">50</a>)&mdash;likewise reflect Mesopotamian usages of the
Protoliterate period (<a href="#fig48">Fig. 48</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> In Mesopotamia the
whole method of recessed brick building can be seen
to come into being, starting with the temples at Eridu
and Tepe Gawra of the Al Ubaid period (when the
buttresses, widely spaced, seem merely to strengthen
the walls), until, in the Protoliterate age (<a href="#fig45">Fig. 45</a>), the
exact degree of complexity was reached with which
brick building appears under the First Egyptian Dynasty,
unheralded, and yet with every refinement of
which the material is capable. Contemporary but
simplified renderings of these buildings on Protoliterate
cylinder seals in Mesopotamia resemble those on First
Dynasty monuments in Egypt (Figs. <a href="#fig42">42</a>, <a href="#fig43">43</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a>
There are differences, too, which indicate that the
Mesopotamian renderings were not copied in Egypt,
but that the Egyptian and Mesopotamian renderings
are abbreviations of buildings which themselves were
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
closely alike. The towers appearing on the Stele of
Djet (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>) are found in the later part of the
Protoliterate period (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a> right). Entrance towers
with straight sides were, since Early Dynastic times, in
use in Mesopotamia but not in Egypt, where the pylon
with a pronounced batter was developed.</p>
<p>In view of this great variety of detailed resemblances
there can be no reasonable doubt that the
earliest monumental brick architecture of Egypt was
inspired by that of Mesopotamia where it had a long
previous history. In conclusion, it is worth notice that
the architectural forms used in Mesopotamia for
temples were applied in Egypt to royal tombs and
royal castles.<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a> But then, Pharaoh&mdash;in life and in death&mdash;was
a god. Stone architecture, so characteristic for
Egypt in historical times, replaced bricks in the royal
tombs from the Third Dynasty onward.</p>
<p>We must turn, finally, to the invention of hieroglyphic
writing. It is a moot point whether it first appears
on the macehead of Scorpion (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>), or
whether the two signs on the Hunters&rsquo; palette (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>)
must count as writing. These cannot be read, although
they may mean &ldquo;shrine of (the earth-god)
Akeru,&rdquo; for this name is written with the double forequartered
animal in the pyramid texts. Whether this
palette or the Scorpion mace is the first inscribed
monument, the appearance of writing falls within a
period in which Mesopotamian influence has been
proved to exist.</p>
<p>It has been customary to postulate prehistoric antecedents
for the Egyptian script, but this hypothesis has
nothing in its favour.<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a> In the annals of the kingdom
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
(which happen to survive in a version of the Fifth
Dynasty), events are recorded only from the First
Dynasty onwards, a fact suggesting that no written
records of earlier times existed. Only some names of
prehistoric Chieftains were still known and entered in
the annals as &ldquo;kings&rdquo; preceding Menes.<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a></p>
<p>But the writing which appeared without antecedents
at the beginning of the First Dynasty was by no means
primitive. It has, in fact, a complex structure. It includes
three different classes of signs: ideograms, phonetic
signs, and determinatives.<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a> This is precisely the
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
same state of complexity which had been reached in
Mesopotamia at an advanced stage of the Protoliterate
period. There, however, a more primitive stage is
known in the earliest tablets, which used only ideograms.
To deny, therefore, that Egyptian and Mesopotamian
systems of writing are related amounts to
maintaining that Egypt invented independently a complex
and not very consistent system at the very moment
of being influenced in its art and architecture by
Mesopotamia where a precisely similar system had just
been developed from a more primitive stage. To state
this view is, of course, to reject it.</p>
<p>But, again, the Egyptians did not copy the Mesopotamian
system slavishly; they were merely stimulated
to develop a script of their own, once the notion
that language could be rendered graphically had been
conveyed. The writing signs&mdash;the &ldquo;hieroglyphs&rdquo;&mdash;which
they invented have nothing at all in common
with the Mesopotamian signs. They depict Egyptian
objects; they depict them faithfully; and they remain
to the end exact pictures in the majority of cases. In
Mesopotamia the tendency to use abstract symbols was
strong from the beginning, and prevailed at an early
date. And before the middle of the third millennium
even the pictograms had lost all trace of semblance to
the objects they originally rendered (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). This
contrast between the Egyptian and Mesopotamian
scripts undoubtedly has a twofold cause. The Egyptians
always loved the pictorial rather than the abstract
and had a strong inclination towards the concrete.
This tendency (which also prevented them from distorting
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
animal forms for the sake of ornamental
schemes) made them adopt and retain minute images
as writing signs. But, in the second place, writing was
at first used in Egypt for a purpose different from that
to which the Mesopotamians put it. In Mesopotamia
writing was invented to serve the practical needs of
administration. In Egypt it was used, at first, as an element
of monumental art, in the form of legends added
to reliefs (Figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a>, <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <a href="#fig28">28</a>).</p>
<p>The legends fixed the identity of the figures in the
reliefs which could be made explicit only by the
adding of names and titles. But once writing was introduced,
it was&mdash;in Egypt also&mdash;used for practical purposes;
and this required a shorter and more cursive
script. In the tomb of Djet, the fourth king of the First
Dynasty, a note in cursive script has been discovered;<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a>
and it has been pointed out<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> that documents
must have been in common use in the Second Dynasty
since the sign of the papyrus roll, tied up and sealed,
is used from then on. For monumental inscriptions,
however, the pictorial hieroglyphs were used even under
the Roman emperors.</p>
<p>In view of the doubt which persists in many quarters,
it seems worth while to represent the evidence for
Mesopotamian influence in Egypt at about 3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;excluding
writing&mdash;in a table which shows that we are
confronted, not by a few random resemblances, but
by a group of related phenomena. And this is, in fact,
corroborated by the observation that the foreign features
in Egypt all derive from one and the same phase
of Mesopotamian civilization, namely, the later part of
the Protoliterate period.<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> Now this phase (formerly
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
called after Jamdat Nasr) represents an age of expansion:
a richly equipped temple was built at Brak
in Northern Syria (see above, <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>); Mesopotamian
tablets were found not only at Susa in Elam but at
Sialk near Kashan in Central Persia (<a href="#fig51">Fig. 51</a>); and
Mesopotamian cylinders were found, not only at the
places mentioned just now, but as far afield as Cappadocia
and Troy. At a time when Mesopotamian influence
radiated in all directions it was but natural
that it should touch Egypt also. Thus the traces of
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Mesopotamian arts and crafts which we find in pre- and
protodynastic Egypt represent but one more manifestation
of the expansion of Mesopotamia during the
latter part of the Protoliterate period.</p>

<p>It would, however, be an error to see the birth of
Egyptian civilization as a consequence of contact with
Mesopotamia. The signs of change accumulating towards
the end of the predynastic age are too numerous
and the outcome of the change is too emphatically
Egyptian in its general character and its particulars to
allow us to speak of derivation or dependence. In fact,
Mesopotamian influence can be entirely discounted&mdash;except
in the field of writing&mdash;without altering in any
essential respect the outcome of the change. We have
said elsewhere that there is no necessity to assume
Mesopotamian influence in order to explain the development
of Pharaonic civilization, but it so happens
that we have evidence that such influence was, in fact,
exercised. We observe that Egypt, in a period of intensified
creativity, became acquainted with the
achievements of Mesopotamia; that it was stimulated;
and that it adapted to its own rapid development such
elements as seemed compatible with its efforts. It
mostly transformed what it borrowed and after a time
rejected even these modified derivations.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that we cannot yet answer the question
where and how contact between Egypt and Mesopotamia
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
was established. We only know the time at
which it took place. The signs of Sumerian influence
point, one and all, to the Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia,
and more especially to the latter half of that
period; and they appear in Egypt towards the end of
the Gerzean period and during the very beginning of
the First Dynasty. This is, of course, an invaluable
synchronism, even though it is still impossible to express
it in exact dates. It may also have a bearing on
the question in which locality contact was established.</p>
<p>In Egypt, signs of contact with Sumer almost cease
after Narmer&rsquo;s reign; and since contact with Syria increased
rather than diminished during the First Dynasty,
it seems unlikely that the Mesopotamian influences
reached Egypt from the north. The argument is
not conclusive; we have seen that Sumerian culture
moved upstream along the Tigris and Euphrates, and
that a great temple was built at Brak on the Khabur
in North Syria in Protoliterate times. But in Syria we
do not find signs that native culture was deeply affected
by contact with Sumer. This may be due to the
incompleteness of our evidence; or it may be that
Syrian culture was so unprogressive that it could not
profit from such contact in the way Egypt demonstrably
did. But before we accept this view we must
consider an alternative.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Egyptians came into contact
with Mesopotamia in the south, on the route which
led from the Red Sea, past Southern Arabia, to the
Persian Gulf. There are two arguments against this assumption:
it has no analogy in historical times; and
there is absolutely no sign of contact with Egypt to be
found in Mesopotamia. But it is possible that the meeting-place
was a region along the southern route, outside
Sumer. In both Sumerian and Egyptian temples
censing with aromatics was usual. In the time of
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Herodotus, frankincense was used for this purpose in
Babylon, but we do not know at what date this was
first introduced. In Egypt frankincense was known
very early; if that holds good for Sumer also, contact
might have been established in the regions from which
frankincense was obtained&mdash;Southern Arabia or the
Somali coast. There missions might have met, or middlemen
might have acquainted Egyptians with Sumerian
achievements. We know that the route to the Red
Sea from Egypt&mdash;through the Wadi Hammamat&mdash;was
used at a very early date. Archaic statues of the god
Min were found at Koptos at the Egyptian end of that
route.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> They belong to the end of the Gerzean period
or to the First Dynasty, and bear designs scratched on
their sides which include the sword of the swordfish
and pteroceras shells, found in the Red Sea. But the
bearing of these facts upon the question where contact
between Egypt and Sumer took place must remain,
for the moment, a matter of surmise.</p>

the very point at issue by emphasizing the almost insuperable
difficulty of formulating an alien mode of thought. In
transposing the words of a German contemporary I have been
obliged to blur his thoughts and lose shades of meaning at almost
every step: <i>Seele</i>, <i>eminent historisch veranlagt</i>, <i>urweltliche
Leidenschaft</i>, <i>Sorge</i>, derive their overtones and deepest meaning
from a world of thought which includes, at the very least,
German literature of the romantic period; these terms, therefore,
hardly bear translating. It is obvious that the disparity of
terms and concepts is immeasurably greater where an ancient
civilization is concerned.

add that Toynbee&rsquo;s scheme would be no more relevant to Egyptian
history if he shifted the date of his &ldquo;time of troubles&rdquo; to
the second or even the first millennium <span class="small">B.C.</span> The error is one of

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a><i>Op. cit.</i>, III, 248-377. In the history of individuals Toynbee
applies it not only to the Buddha or to saints who of their own
free will withdrew from society in order to clarify their mission
and the message which they were to preach, but also to men
like Thucydides, Dante, and Macchiavelli, who were exiled, and
bitterly lamented their banishment even though it did not destroy
their powers to create. They worked in a solitude not of
their choosing and never returned at all, however effective their
work may have proved to be in the course of time. Toynbee also
applies the formula of &ldquo;Withdrawal-and-Return&rdquo; to social
groups in a manner which fails to explain anything, as, for
instance, when he states that the Nonconformists, after the
Restoration, reacted on persecutions by &ldquo;withdrawing into the
realm of private business in order to return omnipotent, a century
and a half later, as the authors of the Industrial Revolution&rdquo;
(<i>Ibid.</i>, 334). Thus, the interplay of dire necessity and
circumstances of every description is reduced to a formula
which confuses the issue by a theological implication (withdraw
in order to) which in more than one place (<i>e.g.</i> in the image of
the climbers and the mountainside) turns Toynbee&rsquo;s account of
the facts into mythology. I am purposely avoiding a discussion
of Toynbee&rsquo;s examples taken from the Near East or Crete, since
I should then have to correct his facts and should become a
&ldquo;critic aiming instruments at bits and pieces&rdquo; (<i>Horizon</i>, XV
[London, January 1947], 50.) Readers interested in a detailed
criticism by an authority on European history (who likewise
considers principles rather than isolated errors) are referred to
the essay of Professor P. Geyl in <i>Journal of the History of Ideas</i>,
IX (New York, 1948), 93-124.

followed by Anton Moortgat, <i>Fr&uuml;he Bildkunst in Sumer</i> (Leipzig,

by an inadequate delimitation of the successive periods.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_37" href="#fr_37">[37]</a>It would be simple enough if we could equate the beginning
of history with the introduction of writing, as is often done. The
equation holds good for Egypt where the oldest inscriptions
refer to the first identifiable events and personalities and thus,
as records of battles and royal names, form the earliest raw
material of Egyptian history. But in Mesopotamia this is not so;
there civilization took shape, and writing appeared, well before
historical documents in the narrow sense came into being. We
shall see that this difference between Egypt and Mesopotamia
was due to the different purposes which writing and art were
made to serve; but it illustrates that generalizations about history
and prehistory are hazardous even within a limited field.

favourable conditions to irrigate patches of ground. The growth
of bulbous plants and grasses is patently more luxuriant wherever
abundant water reaches them, and this was achieved
artificially by diverting from their narrow channels the snow-fed
streams flowing down from the Sierra Nevada. In spring, before
the streams rose with snow-melt, a dam of boulders, brushwood
and mud was thrown across a creek where it reached the valley
floor.... Above the dam one or two main ditches, sometimes
more than a mile long, were laboriously cut with long poles to
lead the river water out on the gently sloping ground over
which it was distributed by minor channels.... After the
harvest the main dam was pulled down.... There was, however,
no attempt at planting or working the soil, and none of the
cultivated plants grown to the south of the Colorado were
known.&rdquo;

the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, but to a
change of conditions. And by extending its use in this sense, an
impression of violent, and especially of purposeful change is
made which the facts do not suggest.

Mesopotamia, for the Eridu ware is simply an earlier stage of
the Al Ubaid ware. If quibbles about names are disregarded, it
remains true that the earliest settlers of the plain descended
from Persia; the new ware shows an earlier stage of their

Sumerians who created the earliest civilization of Mesopotamia
in the subsequent&mdash;the Protoliterate&mdash;period. But no decisive
proof for a later arrival of the Sumerians has been offered, and
the continuity in cult and architecture support the view that
they were the dominant element in the Al Ubaid period, as they
remained throughout the third millennium in the south of the
country. See also <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>, <a href="#fn_87">n. 1 below</a>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_87" href="#fr_87">[87]</a>The earliest tablets, of the Protoliterate period, seem to be
written in Sumerian. They use the Sumerian sexagesimal system
(with units for 10, 60, 600, and 3600) and refer to Sumerian
gods like Enlil. But Sumerian has no clearly recognized affinity
to other tongues.</div>
<div class="fncont">It is important to realize that the term &ldquo;Sumerian,&rdquo; strictly
speaking, can be used only for this language. There is no
physical type which can be called by that name. From Al Ubaid
times until the present day, the population of Mesopotamia has
consisted of men predominantly belonging to the Mediterranean
or Brown race, with a noticeable admixture of broad-headed
mountaineers from the north-east. This is, for instance, true
of the Early Dynastic period, as the skulls from Al Ubaid and
Kish show. Skeletons of the earliest known inhabitants of the
plain, found at Eridu and Hassuna, have been briefly discussed
by C. S. Coon in <i>Sumer</i>, V (1949), 103-6; VI (1950), 93-6.
They represent &ldquo;rather heavy-boned prognathous and large-toothed
mediterraneans.&rdquo; The much-discussed problem of the
origin of the Sumerians may well turn out to be the chase
of a chimera.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_91" href="#fr_91">[91]</a>It is sometimes said that the Sumerians, descending from
a mountainous region, desired to continue the worship of their
gods on &ldquo;High Places&rdquo; and therefore proceeded to construct
them in the plain. The point is why they considered &ldquo;High
Places&rdquo; appropriate, especially since the gods worshipped there
were not sky gods only but also, and predominantly, chthonic
gods. Our interpretation takes its starting-point from &ldquo;the
mountain,&rdquo; not as a geographical feature, but as a phenomenon
charged with religious meaning. Several current theories have
taken one or more aspects of &ldquo;the mountain&rdquo; as a religious
symbol into account and we do not exclude them, but consider
them, on the whole, subsidiary to the primary notion that &ldquo;the
mountain&rdquo; was seen as the normal setting of divine activity.&mdash;The
whole material referring to the temple towers, and the
various interpretations which have been put forward, are conveniently
presented in Andr&eacute; Parrot, <i>Ziggurats et Tour de Babel</i>
(Paris, 1949).
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_92" href="#fr_92">[92]</a>The basic work on the subject of early Mesopotamian
writing is Adam Falkenstein, <i>Archaische Texte aus Uruk</i> (Leipzig,
1936).
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_93" href="#fr_93">[93]</a>A few words may be added here about the early development
of writing; although true pictograms&mdash;images of the objects
(<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>)&mdash;occur, many of the most common objects are
rendered by simpler tokens: either highly abbreviated (and
hence conventional) pictures, such as a figure with two curved
lines across one end (No. 4), which represented the horned
head of an ox (the sign means &ldquo;ox&rdquo;), or, more often, purely
arbitrary signs, such as a circle with a cross&mdash;the commonest
sign of all&mdash;meaning &ldquo;sheep.&rdquo; The system, therefore, is a collection
of abstract tokens eked out with pictograms. The range
of notions which could be expressed was enlarged by certain
combinations. The sign for &ldquo;woman&rdquo; combined with that for
&ldquo;mountain&rdquo; meant &ldquo;slave-girl,&rdquo; since slaves were foreigners
generally brought from Persia. The sign for &ldquo;sun&rdquo; could also
mean &ldquo;day&rdquo; or &ldquo;white.&rdquo; That for &ldquo;plough&rdquo; could mean either
the tool or its user, the ploughman. Even so the script was of
limited usefulness. It could not render sentences, for it could
not indicate grammatical relations. Its signs were ideograms
which listed notions; and that was what the script was, first
of all, required to do. But even within the Protoliterate period
a further step was taken towards writing as the graphic rendering
of language. We find that the arrow sign, for instance, was
soon regarded, not as a rendering of the notion &ldquo;arrow,&rdquo; but
as a rendering of the sound &ldquo;ti,&rdquo; which means arrow. For the
arrow sign was also used to render the notion &ldquo;life&rdquo; which
likewise sounded &ldquo;ti.&rdquo; This shows that the rendering of speech
rather than notions had become possible. The development of
writing consisted of a series of makeshifts and compromises introduced
piecemeal when the shortcomings of the system being
used became noticeable. Some signs acquired a variety of sound
values. Some were used to clarify the sense of other groups,
although they themselves were not pronounced at all. (These
are called determinatives.) Thus &ldquo;ti&rdquo; when it meant &ldquo;arrow&rdquo;
(and certain other implements) was accompanied by a sign
which by itself read &ldquo;gish&rdquo; and meant &ldquo;wood,&rdquo; but which,
used as a determinative, merely indicated that an implement
of wood was referred to. Similarly, place-names were accompanied
by the sign &ldquo;ki,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;earth,&rdquo; divine names by the
star sign, and so on. Nevertheless, the fact that phonetic values
became attached to most of the signs made the rendering of
grammatical endings, and, in short, of true speech, possible.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_94" href="#fr_94">[94]</a>From Protoliterate times onwards, officials, and later also
private persons, owned seals with which they could mark merchandise
or documents. The shape of these seals was peculiar
and remained characteristic for Mesopotamia until the end of
its independent existence in Hellenistic times. They were small
stone cylinders carrying on their circumference an engraved design
which could be impressed on a tablet or on the clay sealing
of a jar or bale of goods. Since the purpose of the seal design
was the making of an individual and recognizable impression,
its engraving at all times challenged the inventiveness of the
Mesopotamian artists, who responded with outstanding success.
(In our illustrations the rolled-out impressions, not the seals
themselves, are shown. But see Figs. <a href="#fig35">35</a>-9.)
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_95" href="#fr_95">[95]</a>The inlays consisted of terra cotta plaques set in among the
clay cones which covered the walls. The carved figures were
executed in stone and fixed to the wall with copper wire through
loops drilled in their backs (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>).
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_96" href="#fr_96">[96]</a>The same applies to the &ldquo;urban revolution&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase often
used to describe the birth of civilization. This term has been
introduced by V. Gordon Childe, whose great achievement has
been the replacement of period-distinctions, which had only
typological significance, by others which suggest socio-economic
differences. However, in the later editions of his <i>Dawn of European
Civilization</i>, in <i>Man Makes Himself</i>, and in <i>What Happened
in History</i>, his point of view has assumed a Marxist slant
which applies to ancient Near Eastern conditions inappropriate
categories. His recent article, &ldquo;The Urban Revolution,&rdquo; in <i>The
Town Planning Review</i>, XXI (Liverpool, 1950), 3-17, and his
recent L. T. Hobhouse Memorial Lecture, &ldquo;Social Worlds of
Knowledge&rdquo; (London, 1949), seem to embody, however, a
change of viewpoint. As regards the term &ldquo;urban revolution,&rdquo;
it can in no way be applied to Egypt, as we shall see, even if
we should accept it, with the qualifications stated in our text,
for the transition from prehistory to history in Mesopotamia.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_97" href="#fr_97">[97]</a>This matter has been studied by Professor Elizabeth Visser

bearded figure in a long garment is throughout the main actor.
He wears his hair wound round his head and gathered in a
chignon at the back, a style usual with rulers in the Early Dynastic
period. But it should be remembered that the Protoliterate
objects on which he appears derive from Erech where, according
to the Epic of Gilgamesh, there was a permanent king in
very early times. (This was possibly connected with the cult of
Inanna.) Note, however, that even Gilgamesh consulted the assembly
and the elders before he embarked on a course of action
which entailed the risk of war (<i>Journal of Near Eastern Studies</i>,

society of the ideal temple community which we have

the rule of Akkad. Utuhegal&rsquo;s &ldquo;pride in new independence and

compilation of the country-wide list in which the traditional
lists of local rulers of the important cities were combined

struggles in which large parts of the Nile valley appear united
under rival chiefs: a Theban family of Antefs and Mentuhoteps
leading Upper Egypt against the royal house residing at Herakleopolis;
or Kamose or Ahmose leading, first the Thebaid,
then the whole Nile valley, against the foreign Hyksos in the
Delta.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_144" href="#fr_144">[144]</a>We may note in passing that the rudiments of the official
hierarchy were established in the First Dynasty. Cylinder seals
of that period (Figs. <a href="#fig35">35</a>, <a href="#fig36">36</a>) bear titles (and presumably
names) of officials. The investiture with a cylinder seal confirmed
the official in his function, and the term <i>&#347;&lsquo;&#7717;w</i>, which is
usually translated &ldquo;noble,&rdquo; in reality means &ldquo;he who owns a

<i>Ancient Egyptian Religion</i>, 43-6). In any case, the rarity of
written documents obliged us to telescope in this chapter evidence
much more widely spread through time than we used in
our description of Mesopotamia. We have attempted to stress
the features of society which we believe to have been present
well-nigh from the first and which remained fairly permanent.

329-58. In this last article, I have formulated disagreement with
certain ideas propounded by Scharff, especially as regards cylinder
seals, and have shown (<i>op. cit.</i>, 354, n. 55) that the relief
of shell in Berlin (also depicted by Capart, <i>op. cit.</i>, 83, Figs.

the Small Hierakonpolis palette and Egyptian renderings of the
historical periods. In Mesopotamia the prey is rendered as unaffected
by the attack; our <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>, for instance, can be matched
by a seal (Frankfort, <i>Cylinder Seals</i>, Plate V <i>a</i>) where a lion is
shown striking his claws into a bull&rsquo;s hindquarters. The bull
stands as in our figure. This is but one example from many. Another
instance of this rendering in Egypt is found on a macehead
from Hierakonpolis (Capart, <i>op. cit.</i>, 97, Fig. 68) with
alternating dogs and lions, each of which attacks the one before
him with teeth and claws. This type of design, a circular interlocking
by activation of the individual figures, is characteristic
for Mesopotamia and occurs on numerous cylinder seals, on the
silver vase of Entemena, and on the macehead of Mesilim of
Kish in the Louvre.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_188" href="#fr_188">[188]</a>See <i>Kingship and the Gods</i>, 20 and 350, n. 15.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_189" href="#fr_189">[189]</a>We have shown that in early Mesopotamian script words
sounding alike (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;to live&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrow&rdquo;) could be written
with the same sign and the meaning clarified by the addition of
determinatives which were not pronounced but indicated what
kind of notion was rendered. In Egypt from the first we find
the same devices in use. The hieroglyph depicting a rib can also
be used to render the verb &ldquo;to approach,&rdquo; in which case two
legs are added as a determinative. Just as in Mesopotamia the
picture of the arrow became a phonetic sign for <i>ti</i>, so the Egyptian
signs become phonetic signs. There is, however, a difference.
In Mesopotamia both consonants and vowels were rendered
by the sign. In Egypt the vowels were ignored, and only
the consonantal skeleton of the word was rendered. This was
natural to the Egyptians, because the consonants of their words
remained constant while the vowels changed in the conjugation
and declension (as with us the verb &ldquo;to break&rdquo; has in the past
tense &ldquo;he broke&rdquo;). To turn to our example, the picture of the
rib stood for <i>spir</i> when it meant rib, <i>soper</i> when it meant &ldquo;to
approach,&rdquo; and so on. (This is the vocalization in Coptic, the
latest stage of Egyptian which used the Greek alphabet and,
therefore, wrote vowels.) The phonetic value of the sign of the
rib is therefore <i>spr</i>. In this way the Egyptians adapted the notion
of how language might be rendered (which they evidently
got from Mesopotamia) to the peculiarities of their own language.
I do not want to suggest that Egyptian necessarily calls
for a script in which only the consonants are written. Scharff
(<i>loc. cit.</i>), points out that Hebrew and Arabic developed in
their punctuation a method of rendering the changing vocalization
alongside the permanent consonantal skeleton of the words.</div>
<div class="fncont">Some of the phonetic signs of Egyptian consist of only one
consonant. In a discussion concerned with Egyptian writing
there would be no reason why they should be mentioned in particular,
since they do not differ in principle from the other signs.
But in a wider historical context the signs with the value of a
single consonant are of unique importance: they seem to be the
distant ancestors of the alphabet.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_192" href="#fr_192">[192]</a>Some features of Mesopotamian civilization remain almost
unaltered during the Protoliterate period, hence it is very important
that the Egyptian links can be proved to derive from
the latter part, which is known to be a time of expansion in any
case. The evidence for the synchronization of the rise of Dynasty
I in Egypt with the later part of the Protoliterate period
in Mesopotamia consists of three groups:</div>
<div class="fncont">(<i>a</i>) The cylinder seals found in Egypt all belong to the
&ldquo;Jamdat Nasr&rdquo; style and do not include any of the earlier
style, known from seal impressions found in Archaic Layer IV
at Erech. Likewise absent are examples of the brocade style
which succeeds the Jamdat Nasr style in Early Dynastic I. Thus
the upper and lower limits of the period during which contact
took place are defined.</div>
<div class="fncont">(<i>b</i>) The small bricks used in recessing at Naqada and
Saqqara (<a href="#fig46">Fig. 46</a>) are predominant in the later part of the
Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia. In the earlier part larger
bricks are commonly used; in the subsequent Early Dynastic
period the bricks are plano-convex.</div>
<div class="fncont">(<i>c</i>) During the Protoliterate period Mesopotamian buildings
were decorated all around with elaborate recesses (Figs. <a href="#fig45">45</a>,
<a href="#fig48">48</a>); and this is the decoration found in the earliest monumental
buildings in Egypt, the tombs at Naqada, Abydos, Saqqara, etc.
In Early Dynastic Mesopotamia simplified recessing all around
became the style; and the multiple recessing was reserved for
towers flanking temple entrances (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>). These towers are
introduced in Mesopotamia in the later half of the Protoliterate
period as a seal impression shows (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a> right). The abbreviated
renderings of recessed buildings in Egypt show both flat
buildings and buildings with towers (<a href="#fig42">Fig. 42</a>, left; <a href="#fig43">43</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>), a
combination which corresponds neither with the earlier part of
the Protoliterate period nor with the Early Dynastic period in
Mesopotamia but only with the later part of the Protoliterate
period. Again, the upper and lower limits of the period of contact
are defined.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
